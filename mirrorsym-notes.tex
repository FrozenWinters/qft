\chapter{Mathematical Preliminaries}

The aim of this chapter is to give a brief review of the required
mathematical background for mirror symmetry.

\section{Cohomology Theories}

Throughout this section, $X$ is a complex manifold, and $H_{\dR}$ is
de Rham cohomology. We examine the relationships between some common
cohomology theories on $X$.

\subsection{Sheaf Cohomology}

All of our sheaves take values in abelian groups. Let $\cF$ be a
presheaf on $X$.

\begin{definition}
  Recall the definition of a {\bf presheaf} $\cF$ on $X$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item (presheaf) every open set $U$ in $X$ is assigned an abelian
    group $\cF(U)$, such that if $V \subseteq U$ are two open sets,
    there is a restriction map $-|_{U \to V}\colon \cF(U) \to \cF(V)$
    compatible with inclusion, i.e. $(-|_{U \to V})|_{V \to W} = -|_{U
      \to W}$ for any $W \subseteq V \subseteq U$.
  \end{enumerate}
  If in addition $\cF$ satisfies the following two properties, it is a
  {\bf sheaf}:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item (locality) if $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$ and $f, g
    \in \cF(X)$ such that $f|_{U \to U_\alpha} = g|_{U \to U_\alpha}$
    for every $U_\alpha$, then $f = g$;
  \item (gluing) if $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$ and
    $f_\alpha \in \cF(U_\alpha)$ for every $U_\alpha$ are elements
    agreeing on overlaps, i.e. such that $f_\alpha|_{U_\alpha \to
      U_\alpha \cap U_\beta} = f_\beta|_{U_\beta \to U_\alpha \cap
      U_\beta}$, then we can glue the $f_\alpha$ together to get $f
    \in \cF(X)$, i.e. $f|_{X \to U_\alpha} = f_\alpha$ for every
    $U_\alpha$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\cU = \{U_\alpha\}$ be an {\bf ordered open cover} of $X$, i.e.
  with a partial order such that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
  incomparable then $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ is empty. A {\bf
    $p$-simplex} $\sigma$ of $\cU$ is a totally ordered collection of
  open sets $U_{\alpha_0}, \ldots, U_{\alpha_p} \in \cU$; we call
  $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p} \coloneqq U_{\alpha_0} \cap \cdots
  \cap U_{\alpha_p}$ its {\bf support}, and often refer to $\sigma$ by
  it instead. The {\bf $k$-th boundary component} of a $p$-simplex
  $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p}$ is given by $\di_k U_{\alpha_0,
    \ldots, \alpha_p} \coloneqq U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \hat{\alpha}_k,
    \ldots, \alpha_p}$. Cochains are maps from simplices to sheaf
  sections, and form a cochain complex:
  \[ C^p(\cU, \cF) \coloneqq \prod_{\alpha_0 < \cdots < \alpha_p} \cF(U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p}), \quad (\delta^p \omega)(\sigma) \coloneqq \sum_{k=0}^{p+1} (-1)^k \omega(\di_k \sigma)|_{\sigma} \colon C^p(\cU, \cF) \to C^{p+1}(\cU, \cF). \]
  The {\bf \v Cech cohomology of $\cU$} with coefficients in $\cF$,
  denoted $\chH^\bullet(\cU, \cF)$, is the cohomology of this complex.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Let $\cF$ be a sheaf. By the gluing condition for a sheaf, a global
  section $f \in \cF(X)$ is defined by its values $f_\alpha \coloneqq
  f|_{X \to U_\alpha} \in \cF(U_\alpha)$ on every $U_\alpha$ in an
  open cover. These $f_\alpha$ form precisely the data for an element
  of $C^0(\cU, \cF)$, and satisfy the gluing condition $f_\alpha =
  f_\beta$ on $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$, which is precisely the
  statement $\delta_0 f = 0$. Hence $\chH^0(\cU, \cF) = \cF(X)$ for a
  sheaf $\cF$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $\cO$ denote the sheaf of holomorphic functions (and $\cO^*$ the
  nowhere-zero ones) on $\bP^1$. Recall that on $\bP^1$ we have the
  charts $U = \bP^1 \setminus \{S\}$ and $V = \bP^1 \setminus \{N\}$,
  with coordinates $u$ and $v$ respectively. To look at sections of
  $\cO(U)$ versus $\cO(V)$, we use the transition map $v = u^{-1}$ on
  $U \cap V$. The cochains for this open cover are
  \[ C^0(\cU, \cO) = \cO(U) \times \cO(V), \quad C^1(\cU, \cO) = \cO(U \cap V), \quad C^k(\cU, \cO) = 0 \; \forall k \ge 2. \]
  We compute the sheaf cohomology.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ($\chH^0(\cU, \cO)$) The boundary map $\delta_0$ maps $(f, g)
    \in C^0(\cU, \cO)$ to $g - f$. But
    \[ f = \sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k u^k, \quad g = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k v^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k u^{-k}, \]
    so $g - f = 0$ iff $f_k = g_k = 0$ for all $k > 0$, and $f_0 =
    g_0$. Hence $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) \cong \bC$, consisting of all
    constant functions.
  \item ($\chH^1(\cU, \cO)$) Given $h \in C^1(\cU, \cO)$, rewrite its
    Laurent expansion:
    \[ h = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty h_k u^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty h_k u^k + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} h_k v^k = -f + g \]
    where $f \in \cO(U)$ and $g \in \cO(V)$. Hence $h \in \im
    \delta_0$, and $\chH^1(\cU, \cO) = 0$.
  \item ($\chH^k(\cU, \cO)$) Trivially, $\chH^k(\cU, \cO) = 0$ for $k
    \ge 2$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Note that $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) \cong \bC$ is consistent with what we
  know so far, since $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) = \cO(\bP^1)$, and Liouville's
  theorem shows that $\cO(\bP^1)$ can only contain constant functions.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Recall the tautological line bundle $\cO(-1)$ and its dual $\cO(1)$
  on $\bP^n$; we have $\cO(n) = \cO(1)^n$. On the same charts on
  $\bP^1$, since $\cO(1)$ has transition function $u = v^{-1}$, we
  know $\cO(n)$ has transition function $u^n = v^{-n}$. To construct a
  global section of $\cO(n)$, given a monomial $v^k$ on $V$, we
  require $u^n v^k = u^{n-k}$ to be well-defined on $U$, so $k \le n$.
  In homogeneous coordinates $[x_0 : x_1]$, the global sections are
  therefore $x_0^n, x_0^{n-1}x_1, \ldots, x_1^n$, the homogeneous
  polynomials of degree $n$. The same story holds on $\bP^N$. Hence
  $\dim H^0(\bP^N, \cO(n)) = \binom{N+n-1}{n-1}$. In particular, there
  are $\binom{9}{5} = 126$ independent global sections of
  $\cO_{\bP^4}(5)$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  The set of all open covers of $X$ form a directed set under
  refinement. The {\bf \v Cech cohomology of $X$} with coefficients in
  $\cF$ is the direct limit $\chH^n(X, \cF) \coloneqq \varinjlim_{\cU}
  \chH^n(\cU, \cF)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  An ordered open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ is {\bf good} if it is
  countable and every finite intersection $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots,
    \alpha_p}$ is either empty or contractible.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Corollary of Theorem 5.4.1]{Godement1997}}]
  The \v Cech cohomology of a good cover $\cU$ is isomorphic to the \v
  Cech cohomology of $X$.
\end{theorem}

One can define {\bf sheaf cohomology} $H^n(X, \cF)$ as the right
derived functors of the global sections functor $\Gamma_X$ (i.e. $\cF
\mapsto \cF(X)$). For us, \v Cech and sheaf cohomology are
indistinguishable as long as we work with sheaves.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 5.10.1]{Godement1997}}]
  If $X$ is a paracompact topological space, then \v Cech cohomology
  $\chH^n(X, \cF)$ and sheaf cohomology $H^n(X, \cF)$ are isomorphic
  for any sheaf $\cF$.
\end{theorem}

\v Cech cohomology is also directly related to de Rham cohomology,
and, as we shall see, Dolbeault cohomology in the complex case. So we
can think of \v Cech cohomology classes as forms.

\begin{theorem}[\v Cech--de Rham isomorphism]
  Let $\bR$ denote the constant sheaf. There is a canonical
  isomorphism $\chH^k(X, \bR) \cong H_{\dR}^k(X)$ for each $k$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By the Poincar\'e lemma, the {\bf de Rham complex} of sheaves
  \[ 0 \to \bR \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^0(X) \xrightarrow{d} \Omega^1(X) \xrightarrow{d} \Omega^2(X) \xrightarrow{d} \cdots \]
  is exact (by checking exactness on the stalks). Let $Z^n \coloneqq
  \ker(d\colon \Omega^k \to \Omega^{k+1})$. The de Rham complex splits
  into a bunch of short exact sequences:
  \[ 0 \to d\Omega^{k-1} \cong Z^k \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^k \xrightarrow{d} Z^{k+1} \to 0. \]
  To each such short exact sequence is associated a long exact
  sequence of (sheaf) cohomology:
  \[ 0 \to H^0(X, Z^k) \to H^0(X, \Omega^k) \to H^0(X, Z^{k+1}) \to H^1(X, Z^k) \to H^1(X, \Omega^k) \to H^1(X, Z^{k+1}) \to \cdots. \]
  Fact: $H^i(X, \Omega^k) = 0$ for every $k$ and $i > 0$ (since
  $\Omega^k$ is a fine sheaf). Hence we obtain isomorphisms
  \[ H^{i+1}(X, Z^0) \cong H^i(X, Z^1) \cong \cdots \cong H^1(X, Z^i). \]
  But $Z^0 \cong \bR$ and we more commonly write
  \[ H^1(X, Z^i) = \coker(H^0(X, \Omega^i) \to H^0(X, Z^{i+1})) = Z^{i+1}(X)/d\Omega^k(X) = H^{i+1}_{\dR}(X). \]
  Hence $\chH^{i+1}(X, \bR) \cong H^{i+1}_{\dR}(X)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on $X$ and $\Omega^{0,q}(E)
  \coloneqq \Omega^{0,q}(X) \otimes \Gamma(E)$ denote the space of
  $E$-valued $(0,q)$-forms. {\bf Dolbeault cohomology} $H^q_{\bdi}(E)$
  is the cohomology of the complex
  \[ \cdots \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q+1}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q+2}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \cdots. \]
  We write $H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$ for $E = \Lambda^pT^{1,0}X$. The
  dimensions $h^{p,q}(X) \coloneqq \dim_{\bC} H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$ are
  the {\bf Hodge numbers} of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[$\bdi$-Poincar\'e lemma]
  $\bdi$-closed, i.e. holomorphic, implies $\bdi$-exact on $\bC^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[\v Cech--Dolbeault isomorphism] \label{thm:cech-dolbeault}
  Let $\Omega^{p,0}$ denote the sheaf of holomorphic $p$-forms on $X$.
  There is a natural isomorphism $\chH^q(X, \Omega^{p,0}) \cong
  H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Analogous to the proof of the \v Cech--de Rham isomorphism, except
  now using the $\bdi$-Poincar\'e lemma to establish the exactness of
  the complex
  \[ 0 \to \ker(\bdi\colon\Omega^{p,0}(X) \to \Omega^{p,1}(X)) \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^{p,0}(X) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{p,1}(X) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \cdots. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Consider the double complex $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$ with
  differentials $\di$ and $\bdi$. The {\bf Fr\"olicher spectral
    sequence} is the spectral sequence of a double complex associated
  to $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$. Since the total complex of
  $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is $\Omega^\bullet(X)$, the Fr\"olicher
  spectral sequence converges to complex de Rham cohomology
  $H^\bullet_{\dR}(X, \bC)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Morse Homology}

Throughout this subsection, $f\colon X \to \bR$ is a smooth function,
and we equip $X$, viewed as a real manifold, with a Riemannian metric
$g$. We also assume $(f, g)$ is Morse--Smale, defined below.

\begin{definition}
  A {\bf critical point} of $f$ is a point $p \in X$ with $df_p = 0$.
  Define the {\bf Hessian}
  \[ H(f)_p\colon T_pX \to T_p^*X, \quad v \mapsto \nabla_v(df), \]
  which is independent of the choice of connection $\nabla$. (In
  coordinates, we recover the usual $\di^2f/\di x_i \di x_j$.) The
  critical point $p$ is {\bf non-degenerate} if the Hessian does not
  have zero eigenvalues. A non-degenerate critical point $p$ has {\bf
    Morse index} $\ind(p)$ the number of negative eigenvalues of the
  Hessian. The function $f$ is {\bf Morse} if all of its critical
  points are non-degenerate.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Recall that the {\bf gradient} of $f$ with respect to a metric $g$
  is the vector field $\grad f$ such that $g(\grad f, X) = Xf$.
  Equivalently, $\grad f = (df)^\sharp$. Let $\psi_t\colon X \to X$ be
  the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms associated to the flow of
  $-\grad f$. The {\bf descending manifold} $D(p)$ and {\bf ascending
    manifold} $A(p)$ at a critical point $p$ are
  \begin{align*}
    D(p) &\coloneqq \{x \in X : \lim_{t \to -\infty} \psi_t(x) = p\} \\
    A(p) &\coloneqq \{x \in X : \lim_{t \to +\infty} \psi_t(x) = p\}.
  \end{align*}
  The pair $(f, g)$ is {\bf Morse--Smale} if $f$ is Morse and $D(p)$
  is transverse to $A(q)$ for every pair of critical points $p$ and
  $q$ (i.e. tangent spaces of $D(p)$ and $A(q)$ generate the tangent
  space at every intersection point).
\end{definition}

Here are two useful and easy-to-prove facts: every flow line
asymptotically approaches critical points, and $\dim D(p) = \ind(p)$
(so $\dim A(p) = \dim X - \ind p$ by the Morse--Smale condition).

\begin{definition}
  Fix critical points $p$ and $q$. A {\bf flow line} from $p$ to $q$
  is an integral curve $\gamma(t)$ of $-\grad f$ with $\lim_{t \to
    -\infty} \gamma(t) = p$ and $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \gamma(t) = q$.
  The {\bf moduli space of flow lines} from $p$ to $q$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \cM(p, q) &\coloneqq \{\text{flow lines from } p \text{ to } q\}/\sim,
    \quad \alpha \sim \beta \text{ if } \exists c \in \bR : \alpha(t) = \beta(t + c) \\
    &= (D(p) \cap A(q)) / \bR.
  \end{align*}
  A {\bf broken flow line} consists, piecewise, of flow lines.
\end{definition}

The Morse--Smale condition implies $D(p) \cap A(q)$ is a submanifold
of $X$ with dimension $\ind(p) - \ind(q)$. Since $\sim$ is a smooth,
proper, free $\bR$-action, $\cM(p, q)$ is a manifold of dimension
$\ind(p) - \ind(q) - 1$ when $p \neq q$ (otherwise the $\bR$-action is
trivial). Note that if $\ind(p) = k$ and $\ind(q) = k-1$ then $\cM(p,
q)$ is zero-dimensional. In fact, in this case, $\cM(p, q)$ is compact
as a corollary of the following theorem, and therefore is a finite set
of points.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 2.1]{Hutchings2012}}]
  Let $X$ be closed and $(f, g)$ Morse--Smale. Then $\cM(p, q)$ has a
  natural compactification to a smooth manifold with corners
  $\overline{\cM(p, q)}$ where
  \[ \overline{\cM(p, q)} \setminus \cM(p, q) = \bigcup_{k \ge 1} \bigcup_{\substack{p,r_1,\ldots,r_k,q\\\text{distinct crit pts}}} \cM(p, r_1) \times \cM(r_1, r_2) \times \cdots \times \cM(r_{k-1}, r_k) \times \cM(r_k, q). \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  If $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 1$, then $\overline{\cM(p, q)} = \cM(p, q)$
  is compact. If $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$, then
  \[ \di \overline{\cM(p, q)} = \bigcup_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \cM(p, r) \times \cM(r, q). \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\dim \cM(r, s) = \ind(r) - \ind(s) - 1$, the space $\cM(r,
  s)$ is non-empty only if $\ind(r) - \ind(s) \ge 1$. Hence
  $\overline{\cM(p, q)}\setminus \cM(p, q) = \emptyset$ when $\ind(p)
  - \ind(q) = 1$. Similar reasoning shows the $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$
  case.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Fix orientations for $D(p)$ at every critical point $p$. There is an
  isomorphism at $x \in \gamma \in \cM(p, q)$ given by
  \begin{align*}
    T_xD(p) &\cong T_x(D(p) \cap A(q)) \oplus (T_xX/T_xA(q)) && \text{transversality from Morse--Smale} \\
    &\cong T_\gamma \cM(p, q) \oplus T_x\gamma \oplus (T_xX/T_xA(q)) && \text{definition of $\cM(p, q)$} \\
    &\cong T_\gamma \cM(p, q) \oplus T_x\gamma \oplus T_qD(q) && \text{translating $T_qD(q)$ along $\gamma$.}
  \end{align*}
  The {\bf orientation} on $\cM(p, q)$ is such that this isomorphism
  is orientation-preserving. Let $C_k$ be the free abelian group
  generated by critical points of index $k$, and define the {\bf
    Morse--Smale--Witten boundary map}
  \[ \di_k^{\Morse}\colon C_k \to C_{k-1}, \quad p \mapsto \sum_{\ind q = k-1} \# \cM(p, q) q \]
  where $\# \cM(p, q) \in \bZ$ is counted with sign according to the
  orientation of $\cM(p, q)$, which here is a discrete set of points.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  $(\di_k^\Morse)^2 = 0$, so $(C_\bullet, \di^\Morse)$ is a chain
  complex.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$. The coefficient of $q$ in
  $(\di^\Morse)^2p$ is
  \[ \sum_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \# \cM(p, r) \cdot \# \cM(r, q) = \# \bigcup_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \cM(p, r) \times \cM(r, q) = \# \di \overline{\cM(p, q)}. \]
  Since $\overline{\cM(p, q)}$ is an oriented $1$-manifold with
  boundary, this quantity, the number of boundary points, is
  zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  {\bf Morse homology} $H_\bullet^\Morse(f, g)$ is the homology of the
  {\bf Morse--Smale--Witten complex} $(C_\bullet, \di^{\Morse})$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The (upright) torus $T^2$ has four critical points with $f$ the
  height function: $p$ (index 2), $q$ and $r$ (index 1), and $s$
  (index 0). This choice of $f$ is Morse, but with the induced metric
  $g$ from $\bR^3$, the pair $(f, g)$ is not Morse--Smale: $D(q) \cap
  A(r)$ is non-empty, but transversality forces it to be. The solution
  is to tilt the torus a little; equivalently, perturb $g$. There are
  two flow lines, of opposite sign, for each relevant pair of critical
  points. Hence $\di_k^\Morse = 0$ for $k = 1, 2$. It follows that
  \[ H_2^\Morse(f, g) = \bZ, \quad H_1^\Morse(f,g) = \bZ^2, \quad H_0^\Morse(f, g) = \bZ. \]
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 3.1]{Hutchings2012}}]
  Let $X$ be a closed smooth manifold, $H_\bullet(X)$ denote singular
  homology on $X$, and $(f, g)$ be a Morse--Smale pair on $X$. Then
  there is a canonical isomorphism $H_n^\Morse(f, g) \cong H_n(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  The number of critical points of a Morse function is at least the
  sum $\sum_k \dim H_k(X)$ of the Betti numbers.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  The number of critical points is the sum of the dimensions of the
  Morse chain groups, which is at least the sum of the dimensions of
  the Morse homology groups, which is equal to the sum of the
  dimensions of the singular homology groups.
\end{proof}

The infinite-dimensional analogue of Morse homology is known as {\bf
  Floer homology}. We shall primarily be concerned with Floer homology
for mirror symmetry.

\subsection{Equivariant Cohomology}



\section{Algebraic Topology}

We stop distinguishing between isomorphic cohomology theories now. In
particular, since $X$ is always at least a smooth manifold, we think
of singular cohomology $H^k(X)$ as de Rham cohomology. For a bundle
$E$, $H^k(E)$ refers to sheaf cohomology.

\subsection{Poincar\'e and Serre Duality}

Unless otherwise stated, $X$ in this section is a compact oriented
$n$-manifold.

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e duality, \cite{Bott1982}]
  Let $X$ be a compact oriented $n$-manifold. The map
  \[ \int_X\colon H^k(X) \otimes H^{n-k}(X) \to \bR, \quad \omega \otimes \eta \mapsto \int_X \omega \wedge \eta \]
  is a perfect pairing, and hence $H^k(X) \cong H^{n-k}(X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

If we relax the assumption that $X$ is compact, then the issue is that
$\int_X$ may not be well-defined. We work around this by using
de Rham cohomology with compact support.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Omega_c^k(X)$ denote the $k$-forms on $X$ with compact
  support. The {\bf de Rham cohomology groups with compact support}
  $H^n_c(X)$ are the cohomology of the chain complex
  $(\Omega_c^\bullet(X), d)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e duality for non-compact manifolds, \cite{Bott1982}]
  Let $X$ be an oriented $n$-manifold without boundary. The map
  \[ \int_X\colon H^k(X) \otimes H^{n-k}_c(X) \to \bR, \quad \omega \otimes \eta \mapsto \int_X \omega \wedge \eta \]
  is a perfect pairing, and hence $H^k(X) \cong H^{n-k}_c(X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  Fix $C \subset X$ a closed $(n-k)$-submanifold. Then Poincar\'e
  duality identifies the map $\int_C\colon H^{n-k}(X) \to \bR$
  with a $k$-form $\eta_C \in H^k(X)$, called the {\bf
    Poincar\'e dual class}. Explicitly, $\int_C \omega = \int_X \omega
  \wedge \eta_C$.
\end{definition}

There is a relation between the Poincar\'e dual class and the Thom
class, which we define below. Namely, the Poincar\'e dual class of $C$
can be constructed as the Thom class of the normal bundle of $C$ in
$X$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 10.4]{Milnor1974}}] \label{thm:thom}
  Let $\pi\colon E \to B$ be an oriented rank $n$ real vector bundle
  and $B$ is embedded into $E$ as the zero section. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item there exists a unique cohomology class $\Phi \in H^n(E, E
    \setminus B)$ called the {\bf Thom class} such that for every $x
    \in B$, the restriction of $\Phi$ to $H^n(E_x, E_x \setminus
    \{0\})$ is the preferred generator specified by the orientation of
    $E_x$ in $E$;
  \item the {\bf Thom isomorphism} $\colon H^k(E) \to H^{k+n}(E, E
    \setminus B)$, given by $\omega \mapsto \omega \wedge \Phi$, is an
    isomorphism for every $k$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Note that since $B$ is a deformation retract of $E$, the rings
$H^*(E)$ and $H^*(B)$ are isomorphic. Hence $\pi^*\Phi = 1 \in H^*(B)$,
which shall be very important in the upcoming proof.

\begin{theorem}[Tubular neighborhood theorem, {\cite[Theorem 11.1]{Milnor1974}}]
  Let $C \subset X$ be a $k$-submanifold embedded in $X$. There exists
  an open neighborhood, called a {\bf tubular neighborhood}, of $C$ in
  $X$ diffeomorphic to the total space of the normal bundle of $C$.
  This diffeomorphism maps points in $C$ to zero vectors.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 6.24a]{Bott1982}}] \label{thm:thom-normal}
  Let $C \subset X$ be a closed $(n-k)$-submanifold. The Poincar\'e
  dual class $\eta_C \in H^k(X)$ of $C$ is the Thom class of the
  normal bundle of $C$ in $X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $NC$ denote the normal bundle of $C$ in $X$, which has rank $k$
  because $C$ is codimension $k$. Use the tubular neighborhood theorem
  to identify $NC$ with an open neighborhood $T$ of $C$ in $X$, and
  then extend by zero to get $\Phi \in H^k(X)$ supported on $T$.

  We shall show that $\int_X \omega \wedge \Phi = \int_C \omega$ for
  any $\omega \in H^{n-k}_c(X)$. The maps $\pi\colon T \to C$ and
  $\iota\colon C \to T$ induce isomorphisms of cohomology, so on forms
  $\omega$ and $\pi^*\iota^*\omega$ differ by at most an exact form
  $d\tau$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \int_X \omega \wedge \Phi
    &= \int_T \omega \wedge \Phi = \int_T (\pi^*\iota^*\omega + d\tau) \wedge \Phi \\
    &= \int_T \pi^*\iota^*\omega \wedge \Phi = \int_C \iota^*\omega \wedge \pi^* \Phi = \int_C \iota^*\omega. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:wedge-dual}
  Transverse intersection is Poincar\'e dual to the wedge product,
  i.e. for $C, D \subset X$ closed submanifolds intersecting
  transversally, $\eta_{C \cap D} = \eta_C \wedge \eta_D$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  For transversal intersections, codimension is additive: $\codim C
  \cap D = \codim C + \codim D$. So the normal bundle of the
  intersection is $N(C \cap D) = NC \oplus ND$. Let $\Phi(E)$ denote
  the Thom class associated to the vector bundle $E$. By the
  characterization of the Thom class, for vector bundles $E$ and $F$
  we have $\Phi(E \oplus F) = \Phi(E) \wedge \Phi(F)$; check that
  $\Phi(E) \oplus \Phi(F)$ restricts on each fiber to the preferred
  generator. Hence
  \[ \eta_{C \cap D} = \Phi(N_{C \cap D}) = \Phi(NC \oplus ND) = \Phi(NC) \wedge \Phi(ND) = \eta_C \wedge \eta_D. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

Let $X$ be a complex $n$-fold now. In the complex setting, we can
refine Poincar\'e duality. The \v Cech--Dolbeault isomorphism
\ref{thm:cech-dolbeault} works for the more general setting in which
we defined Dolbeault cohomology: if $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle
over $X$, then $H^k(X, E) \cong H^k_{\bdi}(E)$. So we think of \v Cech
cohomology classes $H^k(X, E)$ as $E$-valued $(0,k)$-forms.

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf canonical bundle} $K_X$ of a complex $n$-fold $X$ is the
  vector bundle of $(n, 0)$-forms. (Also commonly denoted
  $\Omega^n(X)$.)
\end{definition}

Hence $H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X)$ consists of $E^*$-valued $(n,
n-k)$-forms. Given such a form $\omega$ and another form $\eta \in
H^k(X, E)$, the form $\omega \wedge \eta$ is an $(n, n)$-form with
complex coefficients. We can integrate it to get something in $\bC$.
At this point it is impossible not to wonder about whether the pairing
$H^k(E) \otimes H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X) \to \bC$ given by wedging
and then integrating is perfect.

\begin{theorem}[Serre duality, {\cite[Corollary III.7.13]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  The pairing $H^k(X, E) \otimes H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X) \to \bC$
  is perfect, so $H^k(X, E) \cong H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

Poincar\'e duality combined with Hodge decomposition gives
\[ \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^q(X, \Omega^p) = H^k(X, \bC) \cong H^{2n-k}(X, \bC) = \bigoplus_{p'+q'=2n-k} H^{q'}(X, \Omega^{p'}) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{n-q}(X, \Omega^{n-p}). \]
Serre duality says that in fact, each of the terms in the sum are
isomorphic: $H^q(X, \Omega^p) \cong H^{n-q}(X, \Omega^{n-p})$.

\subsection{Chern Classes via Chern--Weil Theory}

For this subsection, we work over $\bC$, and every vector bundle we
consider is smooth and complex. We define Chern classes using the
Chern--Weil approach. There are other equivalent approaches in more
general settings. But for us, we take $\pi\colon E \to X$ to be a
rank-$n$ smooth complex vector bundle over a smooth manifold $X$. A
connection $A \in \Omega^1(X, \Ad E)$ on $E$ gives a curvature $F_A
\coloneqq dA + A \wedge A \in \Omega^2(X, \Ad E)$.

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf total Chern class} of $E$ is
  \begin{align*}
    c(E) \coloneqq \det\left(1 + \frac{i}{2\pi}F\right)
    &= 1 + \frac{i}{2\pi} \tr(F) + \frac{1}{8\pi}(\tr(F^2) - \tr(F)^2) + \cdots \\
    &= 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \cdots \in H^0(X, \bR) \oplus H^2(X, \bR) \oplus \cdots.
  \end{align*}
  Its terms $c_k(E) \in H^{2k}(X, \bR)$ are the {\bf Chern classes}.
  The total Chern class $c(X)$ of $X$ is defined as $c(X) \coloneqq
  c(T^{1,0}X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Chern--Weil theorem, {\cite[Corollary 4.4.5, Lemma 4.4.6]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  The total Chern class $c(E)$ is closed and independent of the choice
  of connection $A$ on $E$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  A magnetic monopole at the origin in $U(1)$ Maxwell theory is given
  by the trivial line bundle on $\bR^3$ with connection $A =
  i\frac{1}{2r} \frac{1}{z-r} (x dy - y dx)$, where $r$ is the
  coordinate on the fibers of the bundle. Then
  \[ F_A = i\frac{1}{2r^3} (x dy \wedge dz + y dz \wedge dx + z dx \wedge dy) = -\frac{i}{2r^2}(r^2 \sin \theta d\theta \wedge d\phi). \]
  We easily check that $\int_{S^2} c_1 = \frac{i}{4\pi} \int_{S^2} F_A
  = 1$ for any $2$-sphere around the origin.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:chern-axioms}
  The Chern classes satisfy and are uniquely determined by the
  following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $c_0(E) = 1$ and $c_k(E) = 0$ if $k > \dim E$;
  \item (Naturality) if $f\colon Y \to X$ is continuous, then $f^*c(E)
    = c(f^*E)$;
  \item (Whitney product formula) $c(E \oplus F) = c(E) \wedge c(F)$;
  \item $c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1))$ is minus the preferred generator (given
    by the orientation) of $H^2(\bP^1)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Property 1 is clear from the definition of $c_k(E)$. Property 2
  follows from the multiplicative property of the determinant for
  block diagonal matrices; the curvature on $E \oplus F$ splits as a
  curvature on $E$ and a curvature on $F$. Property 3 follows from
  pulling back a connection $A$ on $E$ to a connection $f^*A$ on
  $f^*E$, and then using that pullbacks commute with everything.

  Property 4 is more tedious and serves as our second explicit
  calculation of a Chern class. On $\bP^1$, take the usual charts $(U,
  u)$ and $(V, v)$ with $u = v^{-1}$ on $U \cap V$. The local
  $1$-forms
  \[ A_U = \frac{\bar{u} du}{1 + u\bar{u}}, \quad A_V = \frac{\bar{v} dv}{1 + v \bar{v}} \]
  form the globally-defined {\bf Chern connection} on
  $\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)$, the tautological bundle. We cheat a little and
  work only over $U$ instead of all of $\bP^1$. The curvature is
  \[ F_{A_U} = \frac{(1 + u\bar{u}) d\bar{u} \wedge du - \bar{u} (\bar{u} du + u d\bar{u}) \wedge du}{(1 + u\bar{u})^2} = -\frac{du \wedge d\bar{u}}{(1 + u\bar{u})^2}. \]
  Hence, in real coordinates, $c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)) = -\frac{dx \wedge
    dy}{\pi(1 + x^2 + y^2)^2}$. To compare this with the preferred
  generator, we simply integrate both and compare the result. (This is
  valid since $\dim H^2(\bP^1) = 1$.) We know the preferred generator
  integrates to $1$, whereas
  \[ \int_{\bP^1} c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dx \wedge dy}{(1 + x^2 + y^2)^2} = -\frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r d\theta \wedge dr}{(1 + r^2)^2} = -1. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Splitting principle]
  If $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is a short exact sequence, then $c(B)
  = c(A) \wedge c(C)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Short exact sequences of smooth vector bundles always split: pick a
  metric on $B$ and show that $C \cong A^\perp$. Hence $c(B) = c(A
  \oplus C)$, and then we use the Whitney product formula.
\end{proof}

Note: this is {\bf not} the usual ``splitting principle''. The usual
splitting principle says that to prove an identity on Chern classes,
it suffices to pretend that the bundle completely splits into line
bundles and prove the identity for that case. For more detail, see
\cite[Section 21]{Bott1982}.

\begin{example} \label{ex:chern-proj}
  We compute the total Chern class of $\bP^n$. We first construct the
  {\bf Euler sequence} on $\bP^n$, given by
  \[ 0 \to \bC \to \cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1} \to T^{1,0}\bP^n \to 0. \]
  Since $X = \bP^n$ is $Y = \bC^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$ mod a $\bC^*$
  action, given $n+1$ linear functionals $v_i$ on $\bC^{n+1}$, the
  vector field $\sum_i v_i \di_i$ on $X$ is invariant under this
  $\bC^*$ action and descends to a vector field on $\bP^n$. The $v_i$
  are sections of $\cO_{\bP^n}(1)$, so this construction is the map
  $\cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1} \to T^{1,0}\bP^n$. Its kernel is the line
  bundle associated to $Z = \sum_i x_i \di_i$ (here $x_i$ are the
  coordinates on $Y$): for homogeneous polynomials $f$, we have
  $\frac{1}{d} \sum_i x_i \di_i f = f$. Another way to see this is to
  visualize $\bP^n$ as a sphere in $Y$, so when we project, the radial
  vector field $Z$ and its multiples are precisely the kernel.

  Clearly $c(\bC) = 1$, so by the splitting principle, $c(\bP^n) =
  c(\cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1}) = c(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))^{n+1}$. Let $x =
  c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$. Then $c(\bP^n) = (1 + x)^{n+1}$.
\end{example}

Using the symbol $x$ to stand for $c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$ is fairly
common. We shall do so from now on. (The reason is that $x$ generates
the cohomology ring $H^*(\bP^n)$.)

\begin{example} \label{ex:chern-hypersurface}
  Let $X = V(p)$ be a smooth projective variety in $\bP^n$ with $p$ a
  degree $d$ homogeneous polynomial, i.e. a section of
  $\cO_{\bP^n}(d)$. To compute the Chern class of $X$, we use the {\bf
    adjunction formula} $NX \cong \cO(d)|_X$ (see \cite[Proposition
    2.2.17]{Huybrechts2005} for details), so that
  \[ 0 \to TX \to T\bP^n|_X \to NX \cong \cO(d)|_X \to 0 \]
  is a short exact sequence. Since $\cO(d) = \cO(1)^{\otimes d}$, we
  can't use the Whitney sum property of the Chern class, but we can
  use the Chern character:
  \[ \ch(\cO(d)) = \ch(\cO(1))^d = \exp(x)^d = \exp(dx), \]
  so $c(\cO(d)) = 1 + dx$. Hence $c(X) = (1 + x)^{n+1}/(1 + dx)$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  If we formally factorize the total Chern class as $c(E) =
  \prod_{k=1}^r (1 + a_k)$, then the {\bf Chern character class} is
  \[ \ch(E) \coloneqq \sum_{k=1}^r \exp(a_i) = r + c_1(E) + \frac{1}{2}(c_1(E)^2 - 2c_2(E)) + \cdots. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  In the Chern--Weil setting, $\ch(E) = \tr \exp(iF/2\pi)$.
\end{proposition}

Of course, the Chern character class, being a combination of Chern
classes, does not contain more information than the Chern class. The
reason we work with it instead of the Chern class is the following
proposition.

\begin{proposition}
  The Chern character satisfies
  \[ \ch(E \oplus F) = \ch(E) + \ch(F), \quad \ch(E \otimes F) = \ch(E) \wedge \ch(F). \]
\end{proposition}

Finally, we need to connect the theory of Chern classes with sheaf
cohomology. Consider the short exact sequence of sheaves given by
\[ 0 \to \bZ \to \cO \xrightarrow{\exp} \cO^* \to 0. \]
Its associated long exact sequence of cohomology contains
\[ \cdots \to H^1(X, \bZ) \to H^1(X, \cO) \to H^1(X, \cO^*) \xrightarrow{\delta} H^2(X, \bZ) \to \cdots. \]

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf Picard group} of $X$ is the group of isomorphism classes of
  holomorphic line bundles under tensor product.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Corollary 2.2.10]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  Let $\cO^*$ be the sheaf of nowhere-zero holomorphic functions. Then
  $\Pic(X) \cong H^1(X, \cO^*)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Proposition 4.4.12]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  Under the identification of elements of $H^1(X, \cO^*)$ with
  isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles, the connecting map
  $\delta\colon H^1(X, \cO^*) \to H^2(X, \bZ)$ is the first Chern
  class $c_1$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Euler Class and Euler Characteristic}

Recall that the (holomorphic) Euler characteristic of a sheaf $\cF$ is
$\chi(\cF) \coloneqq \sum_k (-1)^k \dim H^k(X, \cF)$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\pi\colon E \to B$ be an oriented rank $n$ vector bundle over a
  smooth $n$-fold $B$. In \ref{thm:thom} we defined its Thom class
  $\Phi \in H^n(E, E \setminus B)$. The inclusion $(E, \emptyset)
  \subset (E, E \setminus B)$ gives a homomorphism $H^k(E, E \setminus
  B) \to H^k(E)$ which we denote by $\omega \mapsto \omega|_E$. The
  {\bf Euler class} $e(E)$ of $E$ is the image of the Thom class
  $\Phi$ under the composition
  \[ H^n(E, E \setminus B) \xrightarrow{-|_E} H^n(E) \xrightarrow{(\pi^*)^{-1}} H^n(B) \]
  where the last isomorphism is canonical and comes from $B$ being a
  deformation retract of $E$. Again, if $X$ is a manifold, $e(X)
  \coloneqq e(TX)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:euler-chern}
  Whenever both are defined, $e(E) = c_n(E)$ for $E$ of rank $n$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch.]
  Given $E$ a smooth complex vector bundle, $e(E)$ is well-defined
  because the complex structure on $E$ induces an orientation. We can
  use the Euler class to construct the Chern classes \cite[Section
    14]{Milnor1974}. Then it suffices to verify that the Chern classes
  we constructed this way satisfy the four axioms
  \ref{thm:chern-axioms} of Chern classes. For example, the Whitney
  sum formula comes from $\Phi(E \oplus F) = \Phi(E) \wedge \Phi(F)$
  being preserved throughout the construction.
\end{proof}

We like to distinguish between the Euler class and the top Chern class
for several reasons. One is that the Euler class is topological,
whereas the Chern classes are differential geometric. Another is that
it is sometimes easier to prove properties of the Euler class using
properties of the Thom class rather than all the Chern classes,
especially from the Chern--Weil approach.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Property 9.3, Property 9.7]{Milnor1974}}]
  Properties of the Euler class $e(E)$ that do not directly follow
  from $e(E) = c_n(E)$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item if the orientation of $E$ is flipped, $e(E)$ changes sign;
  \item if $E$ has a nowhere zero global section, then $e(E) = 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Property 1 is obvious: flipping the orientation of $E$ flips the
  sign of the Thom class $\Phi$, since $\Phi|_{E_x}$ is the preferred
  generator. Property 2 comes from $B \xrightarrow{s} E \setminus B
  \subset E \xrightarrow{\pi} B$ being the identity for a non-zero
  global section $s$. Then
  \[ H^n(B) \xrightarrow{\pi^*} H^n(E) \to H^n(E \setminus B) \xrightarrow{s^*} H^n(B) \]
  is the identity on $H^n(B)$. But $\pi^*e(E) = \Phi|_E$, the
  restriction of the Thom class, by definition, so we have
  $s^*((\Phi|_E)|_{E \setminus B}) = e(E)$. Since $\Phi \in H^n(E, E
  \setminus B)$, the composition of these two restrictions is zero.
  Hence $e(E) = s^*0 = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:euler-dual}
  Let $E \to M$ be a smooth oriented real vector bundle of rank $r$
  over the smooth compact oriented manifold $M$ of dimension $n \ge
  r$. Let $Z$ be the zero set of a smooth section $s\colon M \to E$
  that is transversal to the zero section $\iota\colon M \to E$. Then
  $Z$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$ of codimension $r$ and there is a
  natural bundle isomorphism $T_ZM \cong E|_M$. Consequently, $e(E)$
  is Poincar\'e dual to $Z$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  A straightforward exercise. Hint: remember that $e(E)$ is the
  restriction of the Thom class, and then use \ref{thm:thom-normal}
  and \ref{thm:wedge-dual}.
\end{proof}

The main purpose of this subsection is the following generalization of
the Gauss--Bonnet theorem. We shall use it extensively when
calculating Euler characteristic. To determine the Euler class
explicitly, we often use many of the preceding results identifying it
with various other objects.

\begin{theorem}[Generalized Gauss--Bonnet]
  Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold. Then
  \[ \int_X e(X) = \chi(X). \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We shall prove this in the next subsection, as a consequence of the
  Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula. (There are much easier proofs,
  though.)
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  We can continue \ref{ex:chern-proj} to compute the Euler
  characteristic of $\bP^n$. Note that every hyperplane $H \cong
  \bP^{n-1} \subset \bP^n$ is Poincar\'e dual to $x$. So $x^n$ is
  Poincar\'e dual to the intersection of $n$ generic hyperplanes,
  which is a point. In other words, $x^n$ is the preferred generator
  given by the orientation, and hence $\int_{\bP^n} x^n = 1$. (For a
  more explicit calculation of this, see \cite[Theorem
    14.10]{Milnor1974}. The explicit form for $x$ is the obvious
  generalization of $-c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1))$, which we computed in
  \ref{thm:chern-axioms}.)

  Since $c(\bP^n) = (1 + x)^{n+1}$, we have $c_n = (n+1) x^n$. Hence
  $\int_{\bP^n} c_n = n+1$. By the generalized Gauss--Bonnet theorem,
  $\chi(\bP^n) = n+1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Recall that the {\bf degree} of a curve in $\bP^2$ is just the
  degree of the defining homogeneous polynomial. (For a more general
  definition of the degree of a variety, see \cite[Section
    I.7]{Hartshorne1997}.) Fact: A degree $d$ curve $X$ in $\bP^2$ has
  Chern class $1 + (3 - d)x$. (Remember we write $x$ for
  $c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$.) Then
  \[ \chi(X) = \int_X c_1(X) = \int_{\bP^2} c_1(X) (xd) = \int_{\bP^2} d(3-d)x^2 = d(3-d). \]
  But for nonsingular curves $X$, we have $\chi(X) = 2 - 2g$. Hence $g
  = (d-1)(d-2)/2 = \binom{d-1}{2}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  By \ref{ex:chern-hypersurface}, a quintic hypersurface $Q$ in
  $\bP^4$ has total Chern class $c(Q) = (1 + x)^5/(1 + 5x) = 1 + 10x^2
  - 40x^3$. (Note that $c_1(Q) = 0$, so $Q$ is Calabi--Yau.) We want
  to compute its Euler characteristic using HRR, but integrating over
  $Q$ is hard. Instead, we use \ref{thm:euler-dual}: $Q$ is defined as
  the zero set of a section of $\cO(5) \to \bP^4$, so $e(\cO(5))$ is
  Poincar\'e dual to $Q$. The Euler class is just the top Chern class
  (see \ref{thm:euler-chern}), so $e(\cO(5)) = c_1(\cO(5))$,
  \[ \chi(Q) = \int_Q e(Q) = \int_Q c_3(Q) = \int_{\bP^4} c_3(Q) \wedge c_1(\cO(5)) = \int_{\bP^4} (-40x^3)(5x) = -200 \int_{\bP^4} x^4 = -200. \]
\end{example}

\subsection{The Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch Formula}

Here $E$ is a rank $r$ holomorphic vector bundle over a compact
complex $n$-fold $X$. The Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula is part of
a long sequence of generalizations of Gauss--Bonnet, relating
geometric quantities to topological quantities.

\begin{definition}
  Again, formally factor $c(E) = \prod_{k=1}^r (1 + a_k)$. The {\bf
    Todd class} is
  \[ \td(E) \coloneqq \prod_{i=1}^r \frac{a_i}{1 - \exp(-a_i)} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}c_1(E) + \frac{1}{2}(c_1(E)^2 + c_2(E)) + \cdots. \]
  The Todd class $\td(X)$ of $X$ is defined as $\td(X) \coloneqq
  \td(TX)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch, {\cite[Theorem A.4.1]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  Let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex
  manifold $X$. Then
  \[ \chi(E) = \int_X \ch(E) \wedge \td(X). \]
  where on the right hand side we only integrate the top form, i.e.
  $\sum_k \ch_k \wedge \td_{n-k}$.
\end{theorem}

We can often use the Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch (HRR) formula to
compute the dimension of a specific cohomology group, either because
some other cohomology groups vanish, or because we know their
dimensions. Before we begin calculating anything, we need the
following helpful result.

\begin{theorem}[Grothendieck's vanishing theorem, {\cite[Theorem 2.7]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  Let $X$ be a Noetherian topological space of dimension $n$. Then
  $H^i(X, \cF) = 0$ for $i > n$ and any sheaf of abelian groups $\cF$.
\end{theorem}

The remainder of this section is examples of the HRR formula. Keep in
mind that we are always working with sheaf cohomology, not de Rham
cohomology. For example, $H^0(TX)$ is by no means equal to $H^0(X)$,
and is not freely generated by connected components of $TX$. Instead,
$H^0(TX) = \Gamma(TX)$, and since global sections generate
automorphisms, $H^0(TX)$ consists of holomorphic automorphisms of $X$.

\begin{example}
  Let $\cM_g$ denote the {\bf moduli space of complex structures} on a
  genus $g$ closed surface. We shall see later (or recall from
  Teichm\"uller theory) that $\dim \cM_g = \dim_{\bC} H^1(TX)$ where
  $X$ is a genus $g$ closed Riemann surface. HRR gives
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_{\bC} H^0(TX) - \dim_{\bC} H^1(TX)
    &= \chi(TX) = \int_X \ch(TX) \wedge \td(TX) \\
    &= \int_X (1 + c_1(TX)) \wedge (1 + (1/2)c_1(TX))
    = \frac{3}{2} \int_X c_1(TX) = 3 - 3g.
  \end{align*}
  The last equality comes from $c_1$ being the top Chern class for
  $X$, i.e. the Euler class, so applying generalized Gauss--Bonnet
  gives $\int_X c_1(TX) = \chi(X) = 2 - 2g$. For $g \ge 2$, the
  Riemann surface $X$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, so $\dim_{\bC}
  H^0(TX) = 0$. Hence $\dim \cM_g = 3g - 3$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  An important object in mirror symmetry is the space of holomorphic
  maps from a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ to a Calabi--Yau $n$-fold $M$,
  i.e. a K\"ahler $n$-fold $M$ with $c_1(M) = 0$. (We'll be more
  careful about the definition of Calabi--Yau later.) An infinitesimal
  deformation of a holomorphic map, given by a vector field $\chi^i$,
  must satisfy $\bdi \chi^i = 0$ if we want the deformed map to still
  be holomorphic. Hence $\chi \in H^0_{\bdi}(\phi^* TM)$, the space of
  such deformations. By HRR,
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_{\bC} H^0(\phi^*TM) - \dim_{\bC} H^1(\phi^*TM)
    &= \int_X \ch(\phi^*TM) \wedge \td(\Sigma) \\
    &= \int_X (n + \phi^*c_1(TM)) \wedge (1 + (1/2)c_1(\Sigma)) = n(1-g).
  \end{align*}
  We assume for now that $H^1(\phi^* TM) = 0$, so the space of
  deformations is $n(1-g)$-dimensional. For $n = 3$ and $g = 0$, the
  dimension is $3$, but there is also a $3$-dimensional group of
  automorphisms of the genus-zero Riemann surface $\bP^1$ which does
  not affect the image curve. Hence the space of genus $0$ holomorphic
  curves inside a Calabi--Yau $3$-fold is zero, and we may be able to
  count them!
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $X$ be a connected compact curve and $L$ a holomorphic line
  bundle on $X$. Fact: the natural isomorphism $H^2(X, \bZ) = \bZ$ is
  given by integration over $X$, and under this isomorphism we have
  $c_1(L) \mapsto \deg(L)$ (\cite[Exercise 4.4.1]{Huybrechts2005}). By
  HRR,
  \[ \chi(L) = \int_X c_1(L) + \frac{1}{2} c_1(X) = \deg(L) + 1 - g. \]
  For the case $L = \cO(D)$ for a divisor $D$ on $X$, we know
  $\dim_{\bC} H^0(L) = \ell(D)$, and by Serre duality $\dim_{\bC}
  H^1(L) = \dim_{\bC} H^0(\cO(K - D)) = \ell(K - D)$ where $K$ is the
  canonical divisor. Hence we recover the classical {\bf Riemann--Roch
    formula} $\ell(D) - \ell(K-D) = \deg D + 1 - g$.
\end{example}

%% \begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e--Hopf index theorem]
%%   Let $M$ be a compact differentiable manifold, and $X$ a vector field
%%   on $M$ with isolated zeros pointing in the outward normal direction
%%   along $\di M$. Then $\sum_i \ind_X(x_i) = \chi(M)$.

%% \begin{example}
%%   Consider the holomorphic vector field $u \pder{}{u}$ on $\bP^1$.
%%   Since $\pder{}{u} = -v^2 \pder{}{v}$, we have $u \pder{}{u} = -v
%%   \pder{}{v}$. Hence this vector field has two zeros at $u = 0$ and $v
%%   = 0$, and these zeros both have index $1$. Note that $\chi(\bP^1) =
