The aim of this chapter is to give a brief review of the required
mathematical background for mirror symmetry.

\section{Cohomology Theories}

Throughout this section, $X$ is a complex manifold, and $H_{\dR}$ is
de Rham cohomology. We examine the relationships between some common
cohomology theories on $X$.

\subsection{Sheaf Cohomology}

All of our sheaves take values in abelian groups. Let $\cF$ be a
presheaf on $X$.

\begin{definition}
  Recall the definition of a {\bf presheaf} $\cF$ on $X$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item (presheaf) every open set $U$ in $X$ is assigned an abelian
    group $\cF(U)$, such that if $V \subseteq U$ are two open sets,
    there is a restriction map $-|_{U \to V}\colon \cF(U) \to \cF(V)$
    compatible with inclusion, i.e. $(-|_{U \to V})|_{V \to W} = -|_{U
      \to W}$ for any $W \subseteq V \subseteq U$.
  \end{enumerate}
  If in addition $\cF$ satisfies the following two properties, it is a
  {\bf sheaf}:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item (locality) if $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$ and $f, g
    \in \cF(X)$ such that $f|_{U \to U_\alpha} = g|_{U \to U_\alpha}$
    for every $U_\alpha$, then $f = g$;
  \item (gluing) if $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$ and
    $f_\alpha \in \cF(U_\alpha)$ for every $U_\alpha$ are elements
    agreeing on overlaps, i.e. such that $f_\alpha|_{U_\alpha \to
      U_\alpha \cap U_\beta} = f_\beta|_{U_\beta \to U_\alpha \cap
      U_\beta}$, then we can glue the $f_\alpha$ together to get $f
    \in \cF(X)$, i.e. $f|_{X \to U_\alpha} = f_\alpha$ for every
    $U_\alpha$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\cU = \{U_\alpha\}$ be an {\bf ordered open cover} of $X$, i.e.
  with a partial order such that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
  incomparable then $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ is empty. A {\bf
    $p$-simplex} $\sigma$ of $\cU$ is a totally ordered collection of
  open sets $U_{\alpha_0}, \ldots, U_{\alpha_p} \in \cU$; we call
  $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p} \coloneqq U_{\alpha_0} \cap \cdots
  \cap U_{\alpha_p}$ its {\bf support}, and often refer to $\sigma$ by
  it instead. The {\bf $k$-th boundary component} of a $p$-simplex
  $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p}$ is given by $\di_k U_{\alpha_0,
    \ldots, \alpha_p} \coloneqq U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \hat{\alpha}_k,
    \ldots, \alpha_p}$. Cochains are maps from simplices to sheaf
  sections, and form a cochain complex:
  \[ C^p(\cU, \cF) \coloneqq \prod_{\alpha_0 < \cdots < \alpha_p} \cF(U_{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p}), \quad (\delta^p \omega)(\sigma) \coloneqq \sum_{k=0}^{p+1} (-1)^k \omega(\di_k \sigma)|_{\sigma} \colon C^p(\cU, \cF) \to C^{p+1}(\cU, \cF). \]
  The {\bf \v Cech cohomology of $\cU$} with coefficients in $\cF$,
  denoted $\chH^\bullet(\cU, \cF)$, is the cohomology of this complex.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Let $\cF$ be a sheaf. By the gluing condition for a sheaf, a global
  section $f \in \cF(X)$ is defined by its values $f_\alpha \coloneqq
  f|_{X \to U_\alpha} \in \cF(U_\alpha)$ on every $U_\alpha$ in an
  open cover. These $f_\alpha$ form precisely the data for an element
  of $C^0(\cU, \cF)$, and satisfy the gluing condition $f_\alpha =
  f_\beta$ on $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$, which is precisely the
  statement $\delta_0 f = 0$. Hence $\chH^0(\cU, \cF) = \cF(X)$ for a
  sheaf $\cF$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $\cO$ denote the sheaf of holomorphic functions (and $\cO^*$ the
  nowhere-zero ones) on $\bP^1$. Recall that on $\bP^1$ we have the
  charts $U = \bP^1 \setminus \{S\}$ and $V = \bP^1 \setminus \{N\}$,
  with coordinates $u$ and $v$ respectively. To look at sections of
  $\cO(U)$ versus $\cO(V)$, we use the transition map $v = u^{-1}$ on
  $U \cap V$. The cochains for this open cover are
  \[ C^0(\cU, \cO) = \cO(U) \times \cO(V), \quad C^1(\cU, \cO) = \cO(U \cap V), \quad C^k(\cU, \cO) = 0 \; \forall k \ge 2. \]
  We compute the sheaf cohomology.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ($\chH^0(\cU, \cO)$) The boundary map $\delta_0$ maps $(f, g)
    \in C^0(\cU, \cO)$ to $g - f$. But
    \[ f = \sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k u^k, \quad g = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k v^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k u^{-k}, \]
    so $g - f = 0$ iff $f_k = g_k = 0$ for all $k > 0$, and $f_0 =
    g_0$. Hence $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) \cong \bC$, consisting of all
    constant functions.
  \item ($\chH^1(\cU, \cO)$) Given $h \in C^1(\cU, \cO)$, rewrite its
    Laurent expansion:
    \[ h = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty h_k u^k = \sum_{k=0}^\infty h_k u^k + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} h_k v^k = -f + g \]
    where $f \in \cO(U)$ and $g \in \cO(V)$. Hence $h \in \im
    \delta_0$, and $\chH^1(\cU, \cO) = 0$.
  \item ($\chH^k(\cU, \cO)$) Trivially, $\chH^k(\cU, \cO) = 0$ for $k
    \ge 2$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Note that $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) \cong \bC$ is consistent with what we
  know so far, since $\chH^0(\cU, \cO) = \cO(\bP^1)$, and Liouville's
  theorem shows that $\cO(\bP^1)$ can only contain constant functions.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:quintics-dim}
  Recall the tautological line bundle $\cO(-1)$ and its dual $\cO(1)$
  on $\bP^n$; we have $\cO(n) = \cO(1)^n$. On the same charts on
  $\bP^1$, since $\cO(1)$ has transition function $u = v^{-1}$, we
  know $\cO(n)$ has transition function $u^n = v^{-n}$. To construct a
  global section of $\cO(n)$, given a monomial $v^k$ on $V$, we
  require $u^n v^k = u^{n-k}$ to be well-defined on $U$, so $k \le n$.
  In homogeneous coordinates $[x_0 : x_1]$, the global sections are
  therefore $x_0^n, x_0^{n-1}x_1, \ldots, x_1^n$, the homogeneous
  polynomials of degree $n$. The same story holds on $\bP^N$. Hence
  $\dim H^0(\bP^N, \cO(n)) = \binom{N+n-1}{n-1}$. In particular, there
  are $\binom{9}{5} = 126$ independent global sections of
  $\cO_{\bP^4}(5)$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  The set of all open covers of $X$ form a directed set under
  refinement. The {\bf \v Cech cohomology of $X$} with coefficients in
  $\cF$ is the direct limit $\chH^n(X, \cF) \coloneqq \varinjlim_{\cU}
  \chH^n(\cU, \cF)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  An ordered open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ is {\bf good} if it is
  countable and every finite intersection $U_{\alpha_0, \ldots,
    \alpha_p}$ is either empty or contractible.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Corollary of Theorem 5.4.1]{Godement1997}}]
  The \v Cech cohomology of a good cover $\cU$ is isomorphic to the \v
  Cech cohomology of $X$.
\end{theorem}

One can define {\bf sheaf cohomology} $H^n(X, \cF)$ as the right
derived functors of the global sections functor $\Gamma_X$ (i.e. $\cF
\mapsto \cF(X)$). For us, \v Cech and sheaf cohomology are
indistinguishable as long as we work with sheaves.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 5.10.1]{Godement1997}}]
  If $X$ is a paracompact topological space, then \v Cech cohomology
  $\chH^n(X, \cF)$ and sheaf cohomology $H^n(X, \cF)$ are isomorphic
  for any sheaf $\cF$.
\end{theorem}

\v Cech cohomology is also directly related to de Rham cohomology,
and, as we shall see, Dolbeault cohomology in the complex case. So we
can think of \v Cech cohomology classes as forms.

\begin{theorem}[\v Cech--de Rham isomorphism]
  Let $\bR$ denote the constant sheaf. There is a canonical
  isomorphism $\chH^k(X, \bR) \cong H_{\dR}^k(X)$ for each $k$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By the Poincar\'e lemma, the {\bf de Rham complex} of sheaves
  \[ 0 \to \bR \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^0(X) \xrightarrow{d} \Omega^1(X) \xrightarrow{d} \Omega^2(X) \xrightarrow{d} \cdots \]
  is exact (by checking exactness on the stalks). Let $Z^n \coloneqq
  \ker(d\colon \Omega^k \to \Omega^{k+1})$. The de Rham complex splits
  into a bunch of short exact sequences:
  \[ 0 \to d\Omega^{k-1} \cong Z^k \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^k \xrightarrow{d} Z^{k+1} \to 0. \]
  To each such short exact sequence is associated a long exact
  sequence of (sheaf) cohomology:
  \[ 0 \to H^0(X, Z^k) \to H^0(X, \Omega^k) \to H^0(X, Z^{k+1}) \to H^1(X, Z^k) \to H^1(X, \Omega^k) \to H^1(X, Z^{k+1}) \to \cdots. \]
  Fact: $H^i(X, \Omega^k) = 0$ for every $k$ and $i > 0$ (since
  $\Omega^k$ is a fine sheaf). Hence we obtain isomorphisms
  \[ H^{i+1}(X, Z^0) \cong H^i(X, Z^1) \cong \cdots \cong H^1(X, Z^i). \]
  But $Z^0 \cong \bR$ and we more commonly write
  \[ H^1(X, Z^i) = \coker(H^0(X, \Omega^i) \to H^0(X, Z^{i+1})) = Z^{i+1}(X)/d\Omega^k(X) = H^{i+1}_{\dR}(X). \]
  Hence $\chH^{i+1}(X, \bR) \cong H^{i+1}_{\dR}(X)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on $X$ and $\Omega^{0,q}(E)
  \coloneqq \Omega^{0,q}(X) \otimes \Gamma(E)$ denote the space of
  $E$-valued $(0,q)$-forms. {\bf Dolbeault cohomology} $H^q_{\bdi}(E)$
  is the cohomology of the complex
  \[ \cdots \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q+1}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{0,q+2}(E) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \cdots. \]
  We write $H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$ for $E = \Lambda^pT^{1,0}X$. The
  dimensions $h^{p,q}(X) \coloneqq \dim_{\bC} H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$ are
  the {\bf Hodge numbers} of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[$\bdi$-Poincar\'e lemma]
  $\bdi$-closed, i.e. holomorphic, implies $\bdi$-exact on $\bC^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[\v Cech--Dolbeault isomorphism] \label{thm:cech-dolbeault}
  Let $\Omega^{p,0}$ denote the sheaf of holomorphic $p$-forms on $X$.
  There is a natural isomorphism $\chH^q(X, \Omega^{p,0}) \cong
  H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Analogous to the proof of the \v Cech--de Rham isomorphism, except
  now using the $\bdi$-Poincar\'e lemma to establish the exactness of
  the complex
  \[ 0 \to \ker(\bdi\colon\Omega^{p,0}(X) \to \Omega^{p,1}(X)) \xrightarrow{\subset} \Omega^{p,0}(X) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \Omega^{p,1}(X) \xrightarrow{\bdi} \cdots. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Consider the double complex $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$ with
  differentials $\di$ and $\bdi$. The {\bf Fr\"olicher spectral
    sequence} is the spectral sequence of a double complex associated
  to $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$. Since the total complex of
  $\Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is $\Omega^\bullet(X)$, the Fr\"olicher
  spectral sequence converges to complex de Rham cohomology
  $H^\bullet_{\dR}(X, \bC)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Morse Homology}

Throughout this subsection, $f\colon X \to \bR$ is a smooth function,
and we equip $X$, viewed as a real manifold, with a Riemannian metric
$g$. We also assume $(f, g)$ is Morse--Smale, defined below.

\begin{definition}
  A {\bf critical point} of $f$ is a point $p \in X$ with $df_p = 0$.
  Define the {\bf Hessian}
  \[ H(f)_p\colon T_pX \to T_p^*X, \quad v \mapsto \nabla_v(df), \]
  which is independent of the choice of connection $\nabla$. (In
  coordinates, we recover the usual $\di^2f/\di x_i \di x_j$.) The
  critical point $p$ is {\bf non-degenerate} if the Hessian does not
  have zero eigenvalues. A non-degenerate critical point $p$ has {\bf
    Morse index} $\ind(p)$ the number of negative eigenvalues of the
  Hessian. The function $f$ is {\bf Morse} if all of its critical
  points are non-degenerate.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Recall that the {\bf gradient} of $f$ with respect to a metric $g$
  is the vector field $\grad f$ such that $g(\grad f, X) = Xf$.
  Equivalently, $\grad f = (df)^\sharp$. Let $\psi_t\colon X \to X$ be
  the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms associated to the flow of
  $-\grad f$. The {\bf descending manifold} $D(p)$ and {\bf ascending
    manifold} $A(p)$ at a critical point $p$ are
  \begin{align*}
    D(p) &\coloneqq \{x \in X : \lim_{t \to -\infty} \psi_t(x) = p\} \\
    A(p) &\coloneqq \{x \in X : \lim_{t \to +\infty} \psi_t(x) = p\}.
  \end{align*}
  The pair $(f, g)$ is {\bf Morse--Smale} if $f$ is Morse and $D(p)$
  is transverse to $A(q)$ for every pair of critical points $p$ and
  $q$ (i.e. tangent spaces of $D(p)$ and $A(q)$ generate the tangent
  space at every intersection point).
\end{definition}

Here are two useful and easy-to-prove facts: every flow line
asymptotically approaches critical points, and $\dim D(p) = \ind(p)$
(so $\dim A(p) = \dim X - \ind p$ by the Morse--Smale condition).

\begin{definition}
  Fix critical points $p$ and $q$. A {\bf flow line} from $p$ to $q$
  is an integral curve $\gamma(t)$ of $-\grad f$ with $\lim_{t \to
    -\infty} \gamma(t) = p$ and $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \gamma(t) = q$.
  The {\bf moduli space of flow lines} from $p$ to $q$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \cM(p, q) &\coloneqq \{\text{flow lines from } p \text{ to } q\}/\sim,
    \quad \alpha \sim \beta \text{ if } \exists c \in \bR : \alpha(t) = \beta(t + c) \\
    &= (D(p) \cap A(q)) / \bR.
  \end{align*}
  A {\bf broken flow line} consists, piecewise, of flow lines.
\end{definition}

The Morse--Smale condition implies $D(p) \cap A(q)$ is a submanifold
of $X$ with dimension $\ind(p) - \ind(q)$. Since $\sim$ is a smooth,
proper, free $\bR$-action, $\cM(p, q)$ is a manifold of dimension
$\ind(p) - \ind(q) - 1$ when $p \neq q$ (otherwise the $\bR$-action is
trivial). Note that if $\ind(p) = k$ and $\ind(q) = k-1$ then $\cM(p,
q)$ is zero-dimensional. In fact, in this case, $\cM(p, q)$ is compact
as a corollary of the following theorem, and therefore is a finite set
of points.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 2.1]{Hutchings2012}}]
  Let $X$ be closed and $(f, g)$ Morse--Smale. Then $\cM(p, q)$ has a
  natural compactification to a smooth manifold with corners
  $\overline{\cM(p, q)}$ where
  \[ \overline{\cM(p, q)} \setminus \cM(p, q) = \bigcup_{k \ge 1} \bigcup_{\substack{p,r_1,\ldots,r_k,q\\\text{distinct crit pts}}} \cM(p, r_1) \times \cM(r_1, r_2) \times \cdots \times \cM(r_{k-1}, r_k) \times \cM(r_k, q). \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  If $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 1$, then $\overline{\cM(p, q)} = \cM(p, q)$
  is compact. If $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$, then
  \[ \di \overline{\cM(p, q)} = \bigcup_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \cM(p, r) \times \cM(r, q). \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\dim \cM(r, s) = \ind(r) - \ind(s) - 1$, the space $\cM(r,
  s)$ is non-empty only if $\ind(r) - \ind(s) \ge 1$. Hence
  $\overline{\cM(p, q)}\setminus \cM(p, q) = \emptyset$ when $\ind(p)
  - \ind(q) = 1$. Similar reasoning shows the $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$
  case.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Fix orientations for $D(p)$ at every critical point $p$. There is an
  isomorphism at $x \in \gamma \in \cM(p, q)$ given by
  \begin{align*}
    T_xD(p) &\cong T_x(D(p) \cap A(q)) \oplus (T_xX/T_xA(q)) && \text{transversality from Morse--Smale} \\
    &\cong T_\gamma \cM(p, q) \oplus T_x\gamma \oplus (T_xX/T_xA(q)) && \text{definition of $\cM(p, q)$} \\
    &\cong T_\gamma \cM(p, q) \oplus T_x\gamma \oplus T_qD(q) && \text{translating $T_qD(q)$ along $\gamma$.}
  \end{align*}
  The {\bf orientation} on $\cM(p, q)$ is such that this isomorphism
  is orientation-preserving. Let $C_k$ be the free abelian group
  generated by critical points of index $k$, and define the {\bf
    Morse--Smale--Witten boundary map}
  \[ \di_k^{\Morse}\colon C_k \to C_{k-1}, \quad p \mapsto \sum_{\ind q = k-1} \# \cM(p, q) q \]
  where $\# \cM(p, q) \in \bZ$ is counted with sign according to the
  orientation of $\cM(p, q)$, which here is a discrete set of points.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  $(\di_k^\Morse)^2 = 0$, so $(C_\bullet, \di^\Morse)$ is a chain
  complex.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 2$. The coefficient of $q$ in
  $(\di^\Morse)^2p$ is
  \[ \sum_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \# \cM(p, r) \cdot \# \cM(r, q) = \# \bigcup_{\ind(r) = \ind(p)-1} \cM(p, r) \times \cM(r, q) = \# \di \overline{\cM(p, q)}. \]
  Since $\overline{\cM(p, q)}$ is an oriented $1$-manifold with
  boundary, this quantity, the number of boundary points, is
  zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  {\bf Morse homology} $H_\bullet^\Morse(f, g)$ is the homology of the
  {\bf Morse--Smale--Witten complex} $(C_\bullet, \di^{\Morse})$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The (upright) torus $T^2$ has four critical points with $f$ the
  height function: $p$ (index 2), $q$ and $r$ (index 1), and $s$
  (index 0). This choice of $f$ is Morse, but with the induced metric
  $g$ from $\bR^3$, the pair $(f, g)$ is not Morse--Smale: $D(q) \cap
  A(r)$ is non-empty, but transversality forces it to be. The solution
  is to tilt the torus a little; equivalently, perturb $g$. There are
  two flow lines, of opposite sign, for each relevant pair of critical
  points. Hence $\di_k^\Morse = 0$ for $k = 1, 2$. It follows that
  \[ H_2^\Morse(f, g) = \bZ, \quad H_1^\Morse(f,g) = \bZ^2, \quad H_0^\Morse(f, g) = \bZ. \]
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 3.1]{Hutchings2012}}]
  Let $X$ be a closed smooth manifold, $H_\bullet(X)$ denote singular
  homology on $X$, and $(f, g)$ be a Morse--Smale pair on $X$. Then
  there is a canonical isomorphism $H_n^\Morse(f, g) \cong H_n(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  The number of critical points of a Morse function is at least the
  sum $\sum_k \dim H_k(X)$ of the Betti numbers.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  The number of critical points is the sum of the dimensions of the
  Morse chain groups, which is at least the sum of the dimensions of
  the Morse homology groups, which is equal to the sum of the
  dimensions of the singular homology groups.
\end{proof}

The infinite-dimensional analogue of Morse homology is known as {\bf
  Floer homology}. We shall primarily be concerned with Floer homology
for mirror symmetry.

\subsection{Equivariant Cohomology}

In this subsection, $G$ is a compact Lie group acting smoothly on $X$.
Cohomology is taken with $\bQ$ coefficients.

The usual cohomology theories fail to capture any information about
this action of $G$ on $X$. Equivariant cohomology is an extension of
the usual cohomology for $X/G$ in order to account for the action. For
example, if $G$ acts smoothly without fixed points, then $X/G$ is a
smooth manifold, and equivariant cohomology agrees with $H^*(X/G)$. On
the other end of the spectrum, if $X = \{\pt\}$, then any $G$-action
fixes $\pt$, and we want equivariant cohomology to give a
cohomological invariant of $G$. To construct equivariant cohomology we
need the machinery of classifying spaces. So we first review some
homotopy theory.

\begin{definition}
  A continuous map $f\colon X \to Y$ of topological spaces is a {\bf
    weak homotopy equivalence} if the induced maps $\pi(f)\colon
  \pi_*(X) \to \pi_*(Y)$ of homotopy groups are isomorphisms. A
  topological space $X$ is {\bf weakly contractible} if $X \to \pt$ is
  a {\bf weak equivalence}. If in addition there is a continuous map
  $g\colon Y \to X$ such that $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are
  homotopic to the identity maps $\id_X$ and $\id_Y$ respectively,
  then $X$ and $Y$ are {\bf homotopy equivalent}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Hurewicz, {\cite[Section 20.1]{Dieck2008}}]
  For any topological space $X$ there exists a group homomorphism
  $h_k\colon \pi_k(X) \to H_k(X)$. If $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected, i.e.
  $\pi_k(X) = 0$ for $1 \le k \le n-1$, then $h_k$ is an isomorphism
  for $1 \le k \le n$, and $h_1$ is the abelianization map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Section 10.8]{Dieck2008}}] \label{thm:homotopy-injlim}
  For $\{X_\alpha\}$ a directed system of Hausdorff
  spaces, $\pi_i (\varinjlim X_\alpha) = \varinjlim \pi_i(X_\alpha)$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Whitehead, {\cite[Theorem 20.1.5]{Dieck2008}}]
  If two connected CW complexes $X$ and $Y$ are weakly homotopy
  equivalent, then they are homotopy equivalent.
\end{theorem}

(This theorem of Whitehead's provided some of the initial
justification for working with CW complexes.) It is true that all
smooth manifolds are homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes (see
\cite[page 220]{Bott1982} for a proof for compact smooth manifolds,
and discussion on the general case). The proof is Morse-theoretic.

\begin{definition}
  If $P \to B$ is a principal $G$-bundle with $P$ weakly contractible,
  then $B$ is a {\bf classifying space} for $G$, denoted $BG$, and $P$
  is a {\bf universal $G$-bundle}, denoted $EG$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Milnor, {\cite[Section 14.4]{Dieck2008}}] \label{thm:classifying-space}
  Let $G$ be any topological group. Then there exists a classifying
  space for $G$ (and a universal $G$-bundle) unique up to canonical
  homotopy equivalence.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  We show that $EG$ exists for closed subgroups of the Lie group
  $\GL(n)$; this is sufficient for our purposes. First, we find
  $E\GL(n)$. Define
  \begin{align*}
    V_n(\bR^k) &\coloneqq \{(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \in (\bR^k)^n \text{ linearly independent}\}, \\
    V_n^O(\bR^k) &\coloneqq \{(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \in (\bR^k)^n \text{ orthonormal}\}.
  \end{align*}
  They are both referred to as the {\bf Stiefel manifold} associated
  to $\Gr_n(\bR^k)$. Note that $\pi\colon V_n(\bR^k) \to \Gr_n(\bR^k)$
  is a principal $\GL(n)$-bundle, where $\pi$ sends $(v_1, \ldots,
  v_n)$ to $\vspan\{v_1, \ldots, v_n\} \in \Gr_n(\bR^k)$. We shall
  show that $V_n(\bR^\infty) \coloneqq \varinjlim_k V_n(\bR^k)$ is a
  universal $\GL(n)$-bundle over $\Gr_n(\bR^\infty)$.

  By Gram--Schmidt, $V_n^O(\bR^k)$ is a deformation retract of
  $V_n(\bR^k)$, so since homotopy commutes with direct limit (see
  \ref{thm:homotopy-injlim}), it suffices to show that $V_n^O(\bR^k)$
  is $(k-1)$-connected. There are fibrations
  \[ V_{n-1}^O(\bR^{k-1}) \to V_n^O(\bR^k) \xrightarrow{(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \mapsto v_n} S^{k-1} \]
  so for $i < k-1$, we have $\pi_i(V_{n-1}^O(\bR^{k-1})) \cong
  \pi_i(V_n^O(\bR^k))$. Hence by induction these homotopy groups
  vanish, as desired, and we have shown $E\GL(n) = V_n(\bR^\infty)$.

  Now let $G \subset \GL(n)$ be a closed Lie subgroup. Take $EG
  \coloneqq V_n(\bR^\infty)$ and let $BG \coloneqq EG/G$. Then $EG \to
  BG$ is a principal $G$-bundle, and by the same argument as above it
  is universal.
\end{proof}

The idea for equivariant cohomology is to start with the possibly
not-free action of $G$ on $X$, find a homotopy equivalent space
$\tilde{X}$ on which $G$ acts freely, and then look at
$H^*(\tilde{X}/G)$. Here is an easy way to get such a space.

\begin{definition}
  Let $E$ be a $G$-bundle over $X$ (which has a $G$-action). Define
  the product
  \[ E \times_G X = E \times X / \sim, \quad (eg, x) \sim (e, gx) \quad \forall e \in E, x \in X, g \in G. \]
  The {\bf homotopy quotient} $X_G$ of $X$ by $G$ is $X_G \coloneqq EG
  \times_G X$. The {\bf equivariant cohomology} of $X$ is $H^*_G(X)
  \coloneqq H^*(X_G)$, the cohomology of the homotopy quotient.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The projection maps from $EG \times X$ induce maps $\sigma\colon X_G
  \to X/G$ and $\pi\colon X_G \to BG$ which fit into the {\bf mixing
    diagram} of Borel and Cartan:
  \[ \begin{CD}
    EG @<<< EG \times X @>>> X   \\
    @VVV        @VVV        @VVV \\
    BG @<\sigma<< X_G @>\pi>> X/G.
  \end{CD} \]
  So there are two ways to view $X_G$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\pi\colon X_G \to X/G$ is a fibered space with the fiber over
    $[Gx]$ being $EG/\{g : gx = x\}$;
  \item $\sigma\colon X_G \to BG$ is a bundle with fiber $X$
  \end{enumerate}
  Using the second perspective, the inclusion of the fiber $i\colon X
  \to X_G$ induces a map $i^*\colon H^*_G(X) \to H^*(X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:eqcoh-point}
  If $X = \{\pt\}$, then $EG \times_G X = (EG \times \{\pt\}) / G =
  EG/G = BG$, so the equivariant cohomology of a point with a
  $G$-action is the cohomology of $BG$, i.e. $H^*_G(\{\pt\}) =
  H^*(BG)$. For a general space $X$, the equivariant map $X \to
  \{\pt\}$ induces an $H^*(BG)$-module structure on $H^*_G(X)$ for any
  $X$. We use the notation $H^*_G \coloneqq H^*_G(\{\pt\}) = H^*(BG)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:eqcoh-free}
  If $G$ acts freely on $X$, then $EG \times_G X = EG \times X/G$. By
  the K\"unneth theorem,
  \[ H^*_G(X) = H^*(EG \times X/G) = H^*(EG) \otimes H^*(X/G) = H^*(X/G) \]
  since $EG$ is weakly contractible, so its cohomology vanishes by the
  Hurewicz theorem. Hence when $X/G$ is a smooth manifold, equivariant
  cohomology indeed agrees with regular cohomology. By the same
  reasoning, if $G$ acts trivially, then $H^*_G(X) = H^*(X) \otimes
  H^*(BG)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:eqcoh-torus}
  Let $G = \bC^*$ act on $\bC^n$ by scalar multiplication. The
  quotient map $\bC^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to \bC\bP^n$ is a principal
  $\bC^*$-bundle. Since $\bC^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$ is homotopy
  equivalent to $S^{2n+1}$, the homotopy groups $\pi_k$ for $k \le 2n$
  vanish, but the higher ones do not necessarily vanish. To fix this
  we take the direct limit of the inclusions $\bC\bP^n \to
  \bC\bP^{n+1} \to \cdots$ (which kills off the homotopy groups one by
  one; see \ref{thm:homotopy-injlim}) to get the universal principal
  $\bC^*$-bundle $\bC^\infty \to \bC\bP^\infty$. Hence $BS^1 =
  \bC\bP^\infty$, and
  \[ H^*_{S^1}(\{\pt\}) = H^*(BS^1) = H^*(\bC\bP^\infty) = \bQ[x], \]
  generated by the Chern class $x = c_1(\cO_{\bP^\infty}(1))$. For a
  {\bf torus action} by $\bT \coloneqq (\bC^*)^{m+1}$,
  \[ H^*_{\bT}(\{\pt\}) = H^*((\bC\bP^\infty)^{m+1}) = \bQ[x_0, \ldots, x_m]. \]
  Since $H^*_{\bT}(X)$ is an $H^*_{\bT}(\{\pt\})$-module, we think of
  elements of $H^*_{\bT}(X)$ as polynomial-valued forms.
\end{example}

It would be nice to have a de Rham-type construction in order to work
with equivariant cohomology classes. This is possible for $G$ a Lie
group: we just have to work with $G$-equivariant forms.

\begin{definition}
  Interpret the symmetric algebra $\Sym(\fg^*)$ as polynomials on
  $\fg$, and therefore $\Sym(\fg^*) \otimes \Omega^*(X)$ as
  polynomials on $\fg$ with coefficients in $\Omega^*(X)$. There is a
  natural $G$-action where $G$ acts on $\fg^*$ by the {\bf coadjoint
    action} $(g \cdot \xi)(Z) \coloneqq X(\Ad_{g^{-1}}Z)$, and $G$
  acts on $\Omega^*(X)$ by pullback. Using this action, the space of
  smooth {\bf $G$-equivariant forms} on $X$ is
  \[ \Omega^*_G(X) \coloneqq (\Sym(\fg^*) \otimes \Omega^*(X))^G, \]
  i.e. $G$-invariant elements of $\Sym(\fg^*) \otimes \Omega^*(X)$.
  Equivalently, they are $G$-equivariant maps $\alpha\colon \fg \to
  \Omega^*(X)$, i.e. $\alpha(Z) = g^{-1}\cdot\alpha(\Ad(g)Z)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Define a grading on $\Omega^*_G(X)$ by
  \[ \deg\colon \Omega^*_G(X) \to \bZ_{\ge 0}, \quad \theta \otimes \omega \mapsto 2\deg_{\text{poly}}(\theta) + \deg_{\text{form}}\omega. \]
  The {\bf equivariant exterior derivative} $d_G\colon \Omega^*_G(X)
  \to \Omega^{*+1}_G(X)$ is given by extending the following map by
  linearity:
  \[ d_G|_{\fg^*}\alpha\colon \fg \to \Omega^*(X), \quad (d_{\fg}\alpha)(Z) \coloneqq d(\alpha(Z)) - \iota_{Z^\#}(\alpha(Z)) \]
  where $d$ is the usual exterior derivative, $\iota$ is contraction,
  and $Z^\#$ is the fundamental vector field associated to $Z \in
  \fg$. The complex $(\Omega^*_G(X), d_G)$ is called the {\bf
    equivariant de Rham complex}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Equivariant de Rham theorem, {\cite[Section 0.2]{Guillemin1999}}]
  Let $G$ be a compact Lie group acting on a compact smooth manifold
  $X$. Then there is an isomorphism between equivariant cohomology and
  the cohomology of the twisted de Rham complex:
  \[ H^*_G(X) \cong H^*(\Omega^*_G(X), d_G). \]
\end{theorem}

This proof should be done from a supersymmetric perspective. In the
literature the result is known as the equivalence between the {\bf
  Borel model} (i.e. our topological definition of equivariant
cohomology) and the {\bf Cartan--Weil model} (i.e. the de Rham
definition).

\section{Algebraic Topology}

We stop distinguishing between isomorphic cohomology theories now. In
particular, since $X$ is always at least a smooth manifold, we think
of singular cohomology $H^k(X)$ as de Rham cohomology. For a bundle
$E$, $H^k(E)$ refers to sheaf cohomology.

\subsection{Poincar\'e and Serre Duality}

Unless otherwise stated, $X$ in this section is a compact oriented
$n$-manifold.

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e duality, \cite{Bott1982}]
  Let $X$ be a compact oriented $n$-manifold. The map
  \[ \int_X\colon H^k(X) \otimes H^{n-k}(X) \to \bR, \quad \omega \otimes \eta \mapsto \int_X \omega \wedge \eta \]
  is a perfect pairing, and hence $H^k(X) \cong H^{n-k}(X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

If we relax the assumption that $X$ is compact, then the issue is that
$\int_X$ may not be well-defined. We work around this by using
de Rham cohomology with compact support.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Omega_c^k(X)$ denote the $k$-forms on $X$ with compact
  support. The {\bf de Rham cohomology groups with compact support}
  $H^n_c(X)$ are the cohomology of the chain complex
  $(\Omega_c^\bullet(X), d)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e duality for non-compact manifolds, \cite{Bott1982}]
  Let $X$ be an oriented $n$-manifold without boundary. The map
  \[ \int_X\colon H^k(X) \otimes H^{n-k}_c(X) \to \bR, \quad \omega \otimes \eta \mapsto \int_X \omega \wedge \eta \]
  is a perfect pairing, and hence $H^k(X) \cong H^{n-k}_c(X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  Fix $C \subset X$ a closed $(n-k)$-submanifold. Then Poincar\'e
  duality identifies the map $\int_C\colon H^{n-k}(X) \to \bR$
  with a $k$-form $\eta_C \in H^k(X)$, called the {\bf
    Poincar\'e dual class}. Explicitly, $\int_C \omega = \int_X \omega
  \wedge \eta_C$.
\end{definition}

There is a relation between the Poincar\'e dual class and the Thom
class, which we define below. Namely, the Poincar\'e dual class of $C$
can be constructed as the Thom class of the normal bundle of $C$ in
$X$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 10.4]{Milnor1974}}] \label{thm:thom}
  Let $\pi\colon E \to B$ be an oriented rank $n$ real vector bundle
  and $B$ is embedded into $E$ as the zero section. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item there exists a unique cohomology class $\Phi \in H^n(E, E
    \setminus B)$ called the {\bf Thom class} such that for every $x
    \in B$, the restriction of $\Phi$ to $H^n(E_x, E_x \setminus
    \{0\})$ is the preferred generator specified by the orientation of
    $E_x$ in $E$;
  \item the {\bf Thom isomorphism} $\colon H^k(E) \to H^{k+n}(E, E
    \setminus B)$, given by $\omega \mapsto \omega \wedge \Phi$, is an
    isomorphism for every $k$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Note that since $B$ is a deformation retract of $E$, the rings
$H^*(E)$ and $H^*(B)$ are isomorphic. Hence $\pi^*\Phi = 1 \in
H^*(B)$.

\begin{theorem}[Tubular neighborhood theorem, {\cite[Theorem 11.1]{Milnor1974}}]
  Let $C \subset X$ be a $k$-submanifold embedded in $X$. There exists
  an open neighborhood, called a {\bf tubular neighborhood}, of $C$ in
  $X$ diffeomorphic to the total space of the normal bundle of $C$.
  This diffeomorphism maps points in $C$ to zero vectors.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 6.24a]{Bott1982}}] \label{thm:thom-normal}
  Let $C \subset X$ be a closed $(n-k)$-submanifold. The Poincar\'e
  dual class $\eta_C \in H^k(X)$ of $C$ is the Thom class of the
  normal bundle of $C$ in $X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $NC$ denote the normal bundle of $C$ in $X$, which has rank $k$
  because $C$ is codimension $k$. Use the tubular neighborhood theorem
  to identify $NC$ with an open neighborhood $T$ of $C$ in $X$, and
  then extend by zero to get $\Phi \in H^k(X)$ supported on $T$.

  We shall show that $\int_X \omega \wedge \Phi = \int_C \omega$ for
  any $\omega \in H^{n-k}_c(X)$. The maps $\pi\colon T \to C$ and
  $\iota\colon C \to T$ induce isomorphisms of cohomology, so on forms
  $\omega$ and $\pi^*\iota^*\omega$ differ by at most an exact form
  $d\tau$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \int_X \omega \wedge \Phi
    &= \int_T \omega \wedge \Phi = \int_T (\pi^*\iota^*\omega + d\tau) \wedge \Phi \\
    &= \int_T \pi^*\iota^*\omega \wedge \Phi = \int_C \iota^*\omega \wedge \pi_* \Phi = \int_C \iota^*\omega
  \end{align*}
  where the last two steps involve the {\bf projection formula}
  \cite[Proposition 6.15]{Bott1982} and noting that $\pi_* \Phi = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:wedge-dual}
  Transverse intersection is Poincar\'e dual to the wedge product,
  i.e. for $C, D \subset X$ closed submanifolds intersecting
  transversally, $\eta_{C \cap D} = \eta_C \wedge \eta_D$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  For transversal intersections, codimension is additive: $\codim C
  \cap D = \codim C + \codim D$. So the normal bundle of the
  intersection is $N(C \cap D) = NC \oplus ND$. Let $\Phi(E)$ denote
  the Thom class associated to the vector bundle $E$. By the
  characterization of the Thom class, for vector bundles $E$ and $F$
  we have $\Phi(E \oplus F) = \Phi(E) \wedge \Phi(F)$; check that
  $\Phi(E) \oplus \Phi(F)$ restricts on each fiber to the preferred
  generator. Hence
  \[ \eta_{C \cap D} = \Phi(N_{C \cap D}) = \Phi(NC \oplus ND) = \Phi(NC) \wedge \Phi(ND) = \eta_C \wedge \eta_D. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

Let $X$ be a complex $n$-fold now. In the complex setting, we can
refine Poincar\'e duality. The \v Cech--Dolbeault isomorphism
\ref{thm:cech-dolbeault} works for the more general setting in which
we defined Dolbeault cohomology: if $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle
over $X$, then $H^k(X, E) \cong H^k_{\bdi}(E)$. So we think of \v Cech
cohomology classes $H^k(X, E)$ as $E$-valued $(0,k)$-forms.

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf canonical bundle} $K_X$ of a complex $n$-fold $X$ is the
  vector bundle of $(n, 0)$-forms. (Also commonly denoted
  $\Omega^n(X)$.)
\end{definition}

Hence $H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X)$ consists of $E^*$-valued $(n,
n-k)$-forms. Given such a form $\omega$ and another form $\eta \in
H^k(X, E)$, the form $\omega \wedge \eta$ is an $(n, n)$-form with
complex coefficients. We can integrate it to get something in $\bC$.
At this point it is impossible not to wonder about whether the pairing
$H^k(E) \otimes H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X) \to \bC$ given by wedging
and then integrating is perfect.

\begin{theorem}[Serre duality, {\cite[Corollary III.7.13]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  The pairing $H^k(X, E) \otimes H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X) \to \bC$
  is perfect, so $H^k(X, E) \cong H^{n-k}(X, E^* \otimes K_X)^*$.
\end{theorem}

Poincar\'e duality combined with Hodge decomposition
\ref{thm:hodge-decomposition} gives
\[ \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^q(X, \Omega^p) = H^k(X, \bC) \cong H^{2n-k}(X, \bC) = \bigoplus_{p'+q'=2n-k} H^{q'}(X, \Omega^{p'}) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{n-q}(X, \Omega^{n-p}). \]
Serre duality says that in fact, each of the terms in the sum are
isomorphic: $H^q(X, \Omega^p) \cong H^{n-q}(X, \Omega^{n-p})$.

\subsection{Chern Classes via Chern--Weil Theory}

For this subsection, we work over $\bC$, and every vector bundle we
consider is smooth and complex. We define Chern classes using the
Chern--Weil approach. There are other equivalent approaches in more
general settings. But for us, we take $\pi\colon E \to X$ to be a
rank-$n$ smooth complex vector bundle over a smooth manifold $X$. A
connection $A \in \Omega^1(X, \Ad E)$ on $E$ gives a curvature $F_A
\coloneqq dA + A \wedge A \in \Omega^2(X, \Ad E)$.

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf total Chern class} of $E$ is
  \begin{align*}
    c(E) \coloneqq \det\left(1 + \frac{i}{2\pi}F\right)
    &= 1 + \frac{i}{2\pi} \tr(F) + \frac{1}{8\pi}(\tr(F^2) - \tr(F)^2) + \cdots \\
    &= 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \cdots \in H^0(X, \bR) \oplus H^2(X, \bR) \oplus \cdots.
  \end{align*}
  Its terms $c_k(E) \in H^{2k}(X, \bR)$ are the {\bf Chern classes}.
  The total Chern class $c(X)$ of $X$ is defined as $c(X) \coloneqq
  c(T^{1,0}X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Chern--Weil theorem, {\cite[Corollary 4.4.5, Lemma 4.4.6]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  The total Chern class $c(E)$ is closed and independent of the choice
  of connection $A$ on $E$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  A magnetic monopole at the origin in $U(1)$ Maxwell theory is given
  by the trivial line bundle on $\bR^3$ with connection $A =
  i\frac{1}{2r} \frac{1}{z-r} (x dy - y dx)$, where $r$ is the
  coordinate on the fibers of the bundle. Then
  \[ F_A = i\frac{1}{2r^3} (x dy \wedge dz + y dz \wedge dx + z dx \wedge dy) = -\frac{i}{2r^2}(r^2 \sin \theta d\theta \wedge d\phi). \]
  We easily check that $\int_{S^2} c_1 = \frac{i}{4\pi} \int_{S^2} F_A
  = 1$ for any $2$-sphere around the origin.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:chern-axioms}
  The Chern classes satisfy and are uniquely determined by the
  following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $c_0(E) = 1$ and $c_k(E) = 0$ if $k > \dim E$;
  \item (Naturality) if $f\colon Y \to X$ is continuous, then $f^*c(E)
    = c(f^*E)$;
  \item (Whitney product formula) $c(E \oplus F) = c(E) \wedge c(F)$;
  \item $c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1))$ is minus the preferred generator (given
    by the orientation) of $H^2(\bP^1)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Property 1 is clear from the definition of $c_k(E)$. Property 2
  follows from the multiplicative property of the determinant for
  block diagonal matrices; the curvature on $E \oplus F$ splits as a
  curvature on $E$ and a curvature on $F$. Property 3 follows from
  pulling back a connection $A$ on $E$ to a connection $f^*A$ on
  $f^*E$, and then using that pullbacks commute with everything.

  Property 4 is more tedious and serves as our second explicit
  calculation of a Chern class. On $\bP^1$, take the usual charts $(U,
  u)$ and $(V, v)$ with $u = v^{-1}$ on $U \cap V$. The local
  $1$-forms
  \[ A_U = \frac{\bar{u} du}{1 + u\bar{u}}, \quad A_V = \frac{\bar{v} dv}{1 + v \bar{v}} \]
  form the globally-defined {\bf Chern connection} on
  $\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)$, the tautological bundle. We cheat a little and
  work only over $U$ instead of all of $\bP^1$. The curvature is
  \[ F_{A_U} = \frac{(1 + u\bar{u}) d\bar{u} \wedge du - \bar{u} (\bar{u} du + u d\bar{u}) \wedge du}{(1 + u\bar{u})^2} = -\frac{du \wedge d\bar{u}}{(1 + u\bar{u})^2}. \]
  Hence, in real coordinates, $c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)) = -\frac{dx \wedge
    dy}{\pi(1 + x^2 + y^2)^2}$. To compare this with the preferred
  generator, we simply integrate both and compare the result. (This is
  valid since $\dim H^2(\bP^1) = 1$.) We know the preferred generator
  integrates to $1$, whereas
  \[ \int_{\bP^1} c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1)) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dx \wedge dy}{(1 + x^2 + y^2)^2} = -\frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r d\theta \wedge dr}{(1 + r^2)^2} = -1. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:chern-dual}
  Let $E$ be a complex vector bundle, and $\bar{E}$ be the same
  underlying real vector bundle as $E$ but with conjugate complex
  structure. Then $c_k(\bar{E}) = (-1)^k c_k(E)$. If $E$ has a
  Hermitian metric, then $E^* \cong \bar{E}$ canonically.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Straightforward exercise: given a connection on $E$, what is the
  connection on $\bar{E}$?
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Splitting principle]
  If $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ is a short exact sequence, then $c(B)
  = c(A) \wedge c(C)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Short exact sequences of smooth vector bundles always split: pick a
  metric on $B$ and show that $C \cong A^\perp$. Hence $c(B) = c(A
  \oplus C)$, and then we use the Whitney product formula.
\end{proof}

Note: this is {\bf not} the usual ``splitting principle''. The usual
splitting principle says that to prove an identity on Chern classes,
it suffices to pretend that the bundle completely splits into line
bundles and prove the identity for that case. For more detail, see
\cite[Section 21]{Bott1982}.

\begin{example} \label{ex:chern-proj}
  We compute the total Chern class of $\bP^n$. We first construct the
  {\bf Euler sequence} on $\bP^n$, given by
  \[ 0 \to \bC \to \cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1} \to T^{1,0}\bP^n \to 0. \]
  Since $X = \bP^n$ is $Y = \bC^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$ mod a $\bC^*$
  action, given $n+1$ linear functionals $v_i$ on $\bC^{n+1}$, the
  vector field $\sum_i v_i \di_i$ on $X$ is invariant under this
  $\bC^*$ action and descends to a vector field on $\bP^n$. The $v_i$
  are sections of $\cO_{\bP^n}(1)$, so this construction is the map
  $\cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1} \to T^{1,0}\bP^n$. Its kernel is the line
  bundle associated to $Z = \sum_i x_i \di_i$ (here $x_i$ are the
  coordinates on $Y$): for homogeneous polynomials $f$, we have
  $\frac{1}{d} \sum_i x_i \di_i f = f$. Another way to see this is to
  visualize $\bP^n$ as a sphere in $Y$, so when we project, the radial
  vector field $Z$ and its multiples are precisely the kernel.

  Clearly $c(\bC) = 1$, so by the splitting principle, $c(\bP^n) =
  c(\cO_{\bP^n}(1)^{n+1}) = c(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))^{n+1}$. Let $x =
  c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$. Then $c(\bP^n) = (1 + x)^{n+1}$.
\end{example}

Using the symbol $x$ to stand for $c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$ is fairly
common. We shall do so from now on. (The reason is that $x$ generates
the cohomology ring $H^*(\bP^n)$.)

\begin{definition}
  If we formally factorize the total Chern class as $c(E) =
  \prod_{k=1}^r (1 + a_k)$, then the {\bf Chern character class} is
  \[ \ch(E) \coloneqq \sum_{k=1}^r \exp(a_i) = r + c_1(E) + \frac{1}{2}(c_1(E)^2 - 2c_2(E)) + \cdots. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  In the Chern--Weil setting, $\ch(E) = \tr \exp(iF/2\pi)$.
\end{proposition}

Of course, the Chern character class, being a combination of Chern
classes, does not contain more information than the Chern class. The
reason we work with it instead of the Chern class is the following
proposition.

\begin{proposition}
  The Chern character satisfies
  \[ \ch(E \oplus F) = \ch(E) + \ch(F), \quad \ch(E \otimes F) = \ch(E) \wedge \ch(F). \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:chern-hypersurface}
  Let $X = V(p)$ be a smooth projective variety in $\bP^n$ with $p$ a
  degree $d$ homogeneous polynomial, i.e. a section of
  $\cO_{\bP^n}(d)$. To compute the Chern class of $X$, we use the {\bf
    adjunction formula} $NX \cong \cO(d)|_X$ (see \cite[Proposition
    2.2.17]{Huybrechts2005} for details), so that
  \[ 0 \to TX \to T\bP^n|_X \to NX \cong \cO(d)|_X \to 0 \]
  is a short exact sequence. Since $\cO(d) = \cO(1)^{\otimes d}$, we
  can't use the Whitney sum property of the Chern class, but we can
  use the Chern character:
  \[ \ch(\cO(d)) = \ch(\cO(1))^d = \exp(x)^d = \exp(dx), \]
  so $c(\cO(d)) = 1 + dx$. Hence $c(X) = (1 + x)^{n+1}/(1 + dx)$.
\end{example}

Finally, we need to connect the theory of Chern classes with sheaf
cohomology. Consider the short exact sequence of sheaves given by
\[ 0 \to \bZ \to \cO \xrightarrow{\exp} \cO^* \to 0. \]
Its associated long exact sequence of cohomology contains
\[ \cdots \to H^1(X, \bZ) \to H^1(X, \cO) \to H^1(X, \cO^*) \xrightarrow{\delta} H^2(X, \bZ) \to \cdots. \]

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf Picard group} of $X$ is the group of isomorphism classes of
  holomorphic line bundles under tensor product.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Corollary 2.2.10]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  Let $\cO^*$ be the sheaf of nowhere-zero holomorphic functions. Then
  $\Pic(X) \cong H^1(X, \cO^*)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Proposition 4.4.12]{Huybrechts2005}}]
  Under the identification of elements of $H^1(X, \cO^*)$ with
  isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles, the connecting map
  $\delta\colon H^1(X, \cO^*) \to H^2(X, \bZ)$ is the first Chern
  class $c_1$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Euler Class and Euler Characteristic}

Recall that the (holomorphic) Euler characteristic of a sheaf $\cF$ is
$\chi(\cF) \coloneqq \sum_k (-1)^k \dim H^k(X, \cF)$.

\begin{definition} \label{def:euler-class}
  Let $\pi\colon E \to B$ be an oriented rank $n$ vector bundle over a
  smooth $n$-fold $B$. In \ref{thm:thom} we defined its Thom class
  $\Phi \in H^n(E, E \setminus B)$. The inclusion $(E, \emptyset)
  \subset (E, E \setminus B)$ gives a homomorphism $H^k(E, E \setminus
  B) \to H^k(E)$ which we denote by $\omega \mapsto \omega|_E$. The
  {\bf Euler class} $e(E)$ of $E$ is the image of the Thom class
  $\Phi$ under the composition
  \[ H^n(E, E \setminus B) \xrightarrow{-|_E} H^n(E) \xrightarrow{(\pi^*)^{-1}} H^n(B) \]
  where the last isomorphism is canonical and comes from $B$ being a
  deformation retract of $E$. Again, if $X$ is a manifold, $e(X)
  \coloneqq e(TX)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:euler-chern}
  Whenever both are defined, $e(E) = c_n(E)$ for $E$ of rank $n$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch.]
  Given $E$ a smooth complex vector bundle, $e(E)$ is well-defined
  because the complex structure on $E$ induces an orientation. We can
  use the Euler class to construct the Chern classes \cite[Section
    14]{Milnor1974}. Then it suffices to verify that the Chern classes
  we constructed this way satisfy the four axioms
  \ref{thm:chern-axioms} of Chern classes. For example, the Whitney
  sum formula comes from $\Phi(E \oplus F) = \Phi(E) \wedge \Phi(F)$
  being preserved throughout the construction.
\end{proof}

We like to distinguish between the Euler class and the top Chern class
for several reasons. One is that the Euler class is topological,
whereas the Chern classes are differential geometric. Another is that
it is sometimes easier to prove properties of the Euler class using
properties of the Thom class rather than all the Chern classes,
especially from the Chern--Weil approach.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Property 9.3, Property 9.7]{Milnor1974}}]
  Properties of the Euler class $e(E)$ that do not directly follow
  from $e(E) = c_n(E)$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item if the orientation of $E$ is flipped, $e(E)$ changes sign;
  \item if $E$ has a nowhere zero global section, then $e(E) = 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Property 1 is obvious: flipping the orientation of $E$ flips the
  sign of the Thom class $\Phi$, since $\Phi|_{E_x}$ is the preferred
  generator. Property 2 comes from $B \xrightarrow{s} E \setminus B
  \subset E \xrightarrow{\pi} B$ being the identity for a non-zero
  global section $s$. Then
  \[ H^n(B) \xrightarrow{\pi^*} H^n(E) \to H^n(E \setminus B) \xrightarrow{s^*} H^n(B) \]
  is the identity on $H^n(B)$. But $\pi^*e(E) = \Phi|_E$, the
  restriction of the Thom class, by definition, so we have
  $s^*((\Phi|_E)|_{E \setminus B}) = e(E)$. Since $\Phi \in H^n(E, E
  \setminus B)$, the composition of these two restrictions is zero.
  Hence $e(E) = s^*0 = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:euler-dual}
  Let $E \to M$ be a smooth oriented real vector bundle of rank $r$
  over the smooth compact oriented manifold $M$ of dimension $n \ge
  r$. Let $Z$ be the zero set of a smooth section $s\colon M \to E$
  that is transversal to the zero section $\iota\colon M \to E$. Then
  $Z$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$ of codimension $r$ and there is a
  natural bundle isomorphism $NZ \cong E|_Z$. Consequently, $e(E)$
  is Poincar\'e dual to $Z$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  A straightforward exercise. Hint: remember that $e(E)$ is the
  restriction of the Thom class, and then use \ref{thm:thom-normal}
  and \ref{thm:wedge-dual}.
\end{proof}

The main purpose of this subsection is the following generalization of
the Gauss--Bonnet theorem. We shall use it extensively when
calculating Euler characteristic. To determine the Euler class
explicitly, we often use many of the preceding results identifying it
with various other objects.

\begin{theorem}[Generalized Gauss--Bonnet]
  Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold. Then
  \[ \int_X e(X) = \chi(X). \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We shall prove this in the next subsection, as a consequence of the
  Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula. (There are much easier proofs,
  though.)
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  We can continue \ref{ex:chern-proj} to compute the Euler
  characteristic of $\bP^n$. Note that every hyperplane $H \cong
  \bP^{n-1} \subset \bP^n$ is Poincar\'e dual to $x$. So $x^n$ is
  Poincar\'e dual to the intersection of $n$ generic hyperplanes,
  which is a point. In other words, $x^n$ is the preferred generator
  given by the orientation, and hence $\int_{\bP^n} x^n = 1$. (For a
  more explicit calculation of this, see \cite[Theorem
    14.10]{Milnor1974}. The explicit form for $x$ is the obvious
  generalization of $-c_1(\cO_{\bP^1}(-1))$, which we computed in
  \ref{thm:chern-axioms}.)

  Since $c(\bP^n) = (1 + x)^{n+1}$, we have $c_n = (n+1) x^n$. Hence
  $\int_{\bP^n} c_n = n+1$. By the generalized Gauss--Bonnet theorem,
  $\chi(\bP^n) = n+1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Recall that the {\bf degree} of a curve in $\bP^2$ is just the
  degree of the defining homogeneous polynomial. (For a more general
  definition of the degree of a variety, see \cite[Section
    I.7]{Hartshorne1997}.) Fact: A degree $d$ curve $X$ in $\bP^2$ has
  Chern class $1 + (3 - d)x$. (Remember we write $x$ for
  $c_1(\cO_{\bP^n}(1))$.) Then
  \[ \chi(X) = \int_X c_1(X) = \int_{\bP^2} c_1(X) (xd) = \int_{\bP^2} d(3-d)x^2 = d(3-d). \]
  But for nonsingular curves $X$, we have $\chi(X) = 2 - 2g$. Hence $g
  = (d-1)(d-2)/2 = \binom{d-1}{2}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:quintic-hypersurface-chern-class}
  By \ref{ex:chern-hypersurface}, a quintic hypersurface $Q$ in
  $\bP^4$ has total Chern class $c(Q) = (1 + x)^5/(1 + 5x) = 1 + 10x^2
  - 40x^3$. (Note that $c_1(Q) = 0$, so $Q$ is Calabi--Yau.) We want
  to compute its Euler characteristic using HRR, but integrating over
  $Q$ is hard. Instead, we use \ref{thm:euler-dual}: $Q$ is defined as
  the zero set of a section of $\cO(5) \to \bP^4$, so $e(\cO(5))$ is
  Poincar\'e dual to $Q$. The Euler class is just the top Chern class
  (see \ref{thm:euler-chern}), so $e(\cO(5)) = c_1(\cO(5))$,
  \[ \chi(Q) = \int_Q e(Q) = \int_Q c_3(Q) = \int_{\bP^4} c_3(Q) \wedge c_1(\cO(5)) = \int_{\bP^4} (-40x^3)(5x) = -200 \int_{\bP^4} x^4 = -200. \]
\end{example}

\subsection{The Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch Formula}

Here $E$ is a rank $r$ holomorphic vector bundle over a compact
complex $n$-fold $X$. The Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula is part of
a long sequence of generalizations of Gauss--Bonnet, relating
geometric quantities to topological quantities.

\begin{definition}
  Again, formally factor $c(E) = \prod_{k=1}^r (1 + a_k)$. The {\bf
    Todd class} is
  \[ \td(E) \coloneqq \prod_{i=1}^r \frac{a_i}{1 - \exp(-a_i)} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}c_1(E) + \frac{1}{2}(c_1(E)^2 + c_2(E)) + \cdots. \]
  The Todd class $\td(X)$ of $X$ is defined as $\td(X) \coloneqq
  \td(TX)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch, {\cite[Theorem A.4.1]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  Let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex
  manifold $X$. Then
  \[ \chi(E) = \int_X \ch(E) \wedge \td(X). \]
  where on the right hand side we only integrate the top form, i.e.
  $\sum_k \ch_k \wedge \td_{n-k}$.
\end{theorem}

We can often use the Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch (HRR) formula to
compute the dimension of a specific cohomology group, either because
some other cohomology groups vanish, or because we know their
dimensions. Before we begin calculating anything, we need the
following helpful result.

\begin{theorem}[Grothendieck's vanishing theorem, {\cite[Theorem 2.7]{Hartshorne1997}}]
  Let $X$ be a Noetherian topological space of dimension $n$. Then
  $H^i(X, \cF) = 0$ for $i > n$ and any sheaf of abelian groups $\cF$.
\end{theorem}

The remainder of this section is examples of the HRR formula. Keep in
mind that we are always working with sheaf cohomology, not de Rham
cohomology. For example, $H^0(TX)$ is by no means equal to $H^0(X)$,
and is not freely generated by connected components of $TX$. Instead,
$H^0(TX) = \Gamma(TX)$, and since global sections generate
automorphisms, $H^0(TX)$ consists of holomorphic automorphisms of $X$.

\begin{example}
  Let $\cM_g$ denote the {\bf moduli space of complex structures} on a
  genus $g$ closed surface. We shall see later (or recall from
  Teichm\"uller theory) that $\dim \cM_g = \dim_{\bC} H^1(TX)$ where
  $X$ is a genus $g$ closed Riemann surface. HRR gives
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_{\bC} H^0(TX) - \dim_{\bC} H^1(TX)
    &= \chi(TX) = \int_X \ch(TX) \wedge \td(TX) \\
    &= \int_X (1 + c_1(TX)) \wedge (1 + (1/2)c_1(TX))
    = \frac{3}{2} \int_X c_1(TX) = 3 - 3g.
  \end{align*}
  The last equality comes from $c_1$ being the top Chern class for
  $X$, i.e. the Euler class, so applying generalized Gauss--Bonnet
  gives $\int_X c_1(TX) = \chi(X) = 2 - 2g$. For $g \ge 2$, the
  Riemann surface $X$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, so $\dim_{\bC}
  H^0(TX) = 0$. Hence $\dim \cM_g = 3g - 3$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  An important object in mirror symmetry is the space of holomorphic
  maps from a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ to a Calabi--Yau $n$-fold $M$,
  i.e. a K\"ahler $n$-fold $M$ with $c_1(M) = 0$. (We'll be more
  careful about the definition of Calabi--Yau later.) An infinitesimal
  deformation of a holomorphic map, given by a vector field $\chi^i$,
  must satisfy $\bdi \chi^i = 0$ if we want the deformed map to still
  be holomorphic. Hence $\chi \in H^0_{\bdi}(\phi^* TM)$, the space of
  such deformations. By HRR,
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_{\bC} H^0(\phi^*TM) - \dim_{\bC} H^1(\phi^*TM)
    &= \int_X \ch(\phi^*TM) \wedge \td(\Sigma) \\
    &= \int_X (n + \phi^*c_1(TM)) \wedge (1 + (1/2)c_1(\Sigma)) = n(1-g).
  \end{align*}
  We assume for now that $H^1(\phi^* TM) = 0$, so the space of
  deformations is $n(1-g)$-dimensional. For $n = 3$ and $g = 0$, the
  dimension is $3$, but there is also a $3$-dimensional group of
  automorphisms of the genus-zero Riemann surface $\bP^1$ which does
  not affect the image curve. Hence the space of genus $0$ holomorphic
  curves inside a Calabi--Yau $3$-fold is zero, and we may be able to
  count them!
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Let $X$ be a connected compact curve and $L$ a holomorphic line
  bundle on $X$. Fact: the natural isomorphism $H^2(X, \bZ) = \bZ$ is
  given by integration over $X$, and under this isomorphism we have
  $c_1(L) \mapsto \deg(L)$ (\cite[Exercise 4.4.1]{Huybrechts2005}). By
  HRR,
  \[ \chi(L) = \int_X c_1(L) + \frac{1}{2} c_1(X) = \deg(L) + 1 - g. \]
  For the case $L = \cO(D)$ for a divisor $D$ on $X$, we know
  $\dim_{\bC} H^0(L) = \ell(D)$, and by Serre duality $\dim_{\bC}
  H^1(L) = \dim_{\bC} H^0(\cO(K - D)) = \ell(K - D)$ where $K$ is the
  canonical divisor. Hence we recover the classical {\bf Riemann--Roch
    formula} $\ell(D) - \ell(K-D) = \deg D + 1 - g$.
\end{example}

We now use HRR to derive two important and powerful formulas: the
Hirzebruch signature theorem, and, as previously promised, the
generalized Gauss--Bonnet theorem.

\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ be a compact complex $n$-fold (and $h^{p,q} \coloneqq
  \dim_{\bC} H^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X)$ be its Betti numbers). The {\bf
    Hirzebruch $\chi_y$-genus} is
    \[ \chi_y \coloneqq \sum_{p=0}^n \chi(X, \Omega^p) y^p = \sum_{p=0}^n \sum_{q=0}^n (-1)^q h^{p,q}(X) y^p. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:chi-genus-formula}
  Factorize $c(X) = \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + a_k)$. Then
  \[ \chi_y = \int_X \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + y \exp(-a_k)) \frac{a_k}{1 - \exp(-a_k)}. \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  If $TX = \bigoplus_{p=0}^n L_i$, then $\bigoplus_{p=0}^n
  \Omega^p(X)y^p = \bigotimes \Omega(yL_i)$. But $\Omega(yL_i)$ is
  just $yT^*L_i$, so we use the fact \ref{thm:chern-dual} that
  $c_1(T^*L_i) = -c_1(TL_i) = a_i$ to get
  \[ \ch\left(\bigoplus_{p=0}^n \Omega^p y^p\right) = \prod_{p=0}^n \ch(\Omega(yL_i)) = \prod_{p=0}^n (1 + y \exp(-a_p)). \]
  Hence by HRR and the definition of the Todd class, we are done.
\end{proof}

We first prove the generalized Gauss--Bonnet theorem using this
formula for $\chi_y$. To simplify the proof we restrict to the case of
compact K\"ahler manifolds (in order to use Hodge decomposition),
which shall be the main setting we work in anyway.

\begin{theorem}[Generalized Gauss--Bonnet] \label{thm:generalized-gauss-bonnet}
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. Then
  \[ \int_X e(X) = \chi(X). \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Note that $\chi(X) = \chi_{-1}$ since by Hodge decomposition
  \ref{thm:hodge-decomposition}, $\sum_{p+q=k} h^{p,q}(X) = b_k(X)$,
  the $k$-th Betti number of $X$. Applying the $\chi_y$ formula
  \ref{thm:chi-genus-formula}, we get
  \[ \chi_{-1} = \int_X \prod_{k=1}^n a_k = \int_X c_n(X) = \int_X e(X) \]
  where the last equality is from \ref{thm:euler-chern}.
\end{proof}

Now we prove the Hirzebruch signature theorem. The big picture is that
on $X$ there is an operator $D$ called the {\bf signature operator}
whose index we want to compute, and Hodge theory tells us that
$\index(D) = \sgn(X)$. The signature theorem says the right hand side
is a topological quantity.

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf signature} $\sgn(X)$ of a compact K\"ahler $n$-fold $X$ is
  the signature of the bilinear form given by the intersection pairing
  $H^n(X, \bR) \times H^n(X, \bR) \to \bR$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Corollary 3.3.18]{Huybrechts2005}}] \label{thm:signature-chi}
  If a compact K\"ahler $n$-fold has $n = 2m$, then $\sgn(X) =
  \sum_{p,q=0}^{2m} (-1)^p h^{p,q}(X)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Hirzebruch signature theorem]
  Let $L(X) \coloneqq \prod_{k=1}^n a_k \coth(a_k/2)$ be the {\bf
    Hirzebruch L-genus}. Then $\sgn(X) = \int_X L(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By \ref{thm:signature-chi}, setting $y = 1$ in the Hirzebruch
  $\chi_y$-genus gives the signature $\sgn(X)$. But using the formula
  \ref{thm:chi-genus-formula} for the $\chi_y$-genus, we get $\sgn(X)
  = \chi_1 = \int_X L(X)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fixed-Point Theorems and Localization}

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e--Hopf index theorem]
  Let $M$ be a compact differentiable manifold, and $X$ a vector field
  on $M$ with isolated zeros $x_i$ and pointing in the outward normal
  direction along $\di M$. Then $\sum_i \ind_X(x_i) = \chi(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $M$ is oriented. (Otherwise take the double cover $\tilde{M}
  \to M$, satisfying $\chi(\tilde{M}) = 2\chi(M)$, and proceed with
  $\tilde{M}$.) From \ref{thm:euler-dual} we see that $e(TM)$ is
  Poincar\'e dual to the zeros of any vector field, in particular,
  $X$. Hence $\int_M e(TM) = \sum_i \ind_X(x_i)$ where $x_i$ are the
  isolated zeros of $X$. But generalized Gauss--Bonnet gives $\int_M
  e(TM) = \chi(M)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Consider the holomorphic vector field $u \pder{}{u}$ on $\bP^1$.
  Since $\pder{}{u} = -v^2 \pder{}{v}$, we have $u \pder{}{u} = -v
  \pder{}{v}$. Hence this vector field has two zeros at $u = 0$ and $v
  = 0$, and these zeros both have index $1$. Note that $\chi(\bP^1) =
  2$.
\end{example}

Writing Poincar\'e--Hopf like $\int_M e(M) = \sum_i \ind_X(x_i)$ for a
vector field tells us that some global integrals can be computed using
local information at a finite set of (fixed) points. This kind of
equation is called a {\bf localization formula}. We shall develop a
localization formula for equivariant cohomology with far-reaching
consequences.

\begin{definition}
  If $\iota\colon V \to X$ is a map of compact manifolds, then there
  is a {\bf pushforward} or {\bf wrong way map} on cohomology
  $\iota_*\colon H^*(V) \to H^{*+k}(X)$: use Poincar\'e duality on
  $V$, push forward the homology cycle, then use Poincar\'e duality on
  $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Let $\iota\colon V \to X$ be an inclusion of compact manifolds and
  let $k$ be the codimension of $V$. Then $\iota_*1 = \Phi(NV)$, the
  Thom form of the normal bundle of $V$. This is straightforward to
  check: the Poincar\'e dual of $1$ is all of $V$, which sits in $X$
  by the inclusion $i$, which is dual, fiberwise, to the preferred
  generator on each fiber, which is precisely the Thom class. The Thom
  form $\Phi(NV)$ can be extended by zero so that it lives in
  $H^k(X)$, and the pullback $\iota^*\colon H^k(X) \to H^k(V)$ then
  gives $\iota^*\Phi(NV) = e(NV)$ (c.f. the definition
  \ref{def:euler-class} of the Euler class). Hence
  \[ \iota^* \iota_* 1 = e(NV). \]
  The composition $\iota^*\iota_*$ is called the {\bf Gysin operation}.
\end{example}

Now we move to the setting for equivariant cohomology: $X$ has an
action by a topological group $G$. The idea is that, compared to
ordinary cohomology, the equivariant cohomology has a larger
coefficient ring, namely the polynomial ring $H^*_G \coloneqq
H^*_G(\{\pt\})$. In ordinary cohomology we cannot invert $e(NV)$, but
in equivariant cohomology we can. However we first need to define
characteristic classes in equivariant cohomology.

\begin{definition}
  A vector bundle $\pi\colon E \to X$ is {\bf equivariant} under the
  $G$-action on $X$ if the action $G \times X \to X$ lifts to $G
  \times E \to E$ in a way such that $\pi$ is equivariant. An
  equivariant vector bundle $E$ induces a vector bundle $E_G \coloneqq
  EG \times_G E$ on the homotopy quotient $EG \times_G X$. An {\bf
    equivariant characteristic class} of $E$ is an ordinary
  characteristic class of $E_G$, which is an element of $H^*(EG
  \times_G X) = H^*_G(X)$. A cohomology class $\alpha \in H^*(X)$ has
  a {\bf equivariant extension} if there exists $\alpha^G \in
  H^*_G(X)$ with $\iota^*\alpha^G = \alpha$ where $\iota\colon X \to
  X_G$ is fiber-wise inclusion.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The {\bf equivariant Chern classes} of a $G$-equivariant rank $n$
  complex vector bundle $\pi\colon E \to X$ are the regular Chern
  classes of $E_G \to X_G$, i.e.
  \[ c_k^G(E) \coloneqq c_k(E_G) = c_k(EG \times_G E) \in H^*(X_G) = H^*_G(X). \]
  In particular the {\bf equivariant Euler class} is the top
  equivariant Chern class $e^G(E) \coloneqq c_n^G(E)$.
\end{example}

For the remainder of this subsection we are always working with
equivariant cohomology, so we omit the superscript $G$ on
characteristic classes. Since we are usually concerned with a torus
action for equivariant cohomology, let $\bT \coloneqq (\bC^*)^m$ be an
algebraic torus acting on $X$. Recall from \ref{ex:eqcoh-torus} that
in this case we can view equivariant cohomology classes as represented
by $H^*_{\bT} = \bQ[x_0, \ldots, x_m]$-valued forms.

\begin{theorem}[Atiyah--Bott, \cite{Atiyah1984}]
  Let $\bT$ be a torus acting on $X$, and split the locus of fixed
  points $F$ into connected components $F_i$. The equivariant Euler
  classes $e_{\bT}(NF_i) \in H^*(F_i) \otimes H^*_{\bT}$ are
  invertible in the localized ring $H^*(F_i) \otimes_{\bQ}
  \Frac(H^*_{\bT})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  Terms of positive degree in $H^*(F_i)$ are nilpotent, so an element
  in $H^*(F_i)$ is invertible if its $H^0$ component is nonzero. So
  $e(NF_i)$ is invertible if its component in $H^0(F_i) \otimes
  H^*_{\bT}$ is a non-zero polynomial. Some work shows this is always
  the case; see page 9 in the cited paper.
\end{proof}

View $X_{\bT}$ as a bundle over $B\bT$ with fiber $X$. Then the
projection $\pi^X\colon X_{\bT} \to B\bT$ induces a wrong-way map
$\pi^X_*\colon H^*_{\bT}(X) \to H^*_{\bT}$ which is precisely
integration over the fibers. To disambiguate, we write integration
over the fibers as $\int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT}$ and integration over $X$ as
  $\int_X$. The relation between the two is given by
\[ \begin{CD}
  X @>\iota>> X_{\bT} \\
  @VVV  @V\pi VV \\
  p @>\iota_p>> B\bT
\end{CD} \qquad\qquad
\iota^*_p\int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT} \tilde{\alpha} = \int_X \iota^*\tilde{\alpha} = \int_X \alpha. \]
Here $\iota^*_p\colon H^*_{\bT} \cong \bQ[x_0, \ldots, x_m] \to
H^*(\{\pt\}) = \bQ$ is essentially the evaluation at zero map.

\begin{corollary}[Atiyah--Bott localization formula] \label{thm:equiv-localization}
  Let $\iota^{F_i}\colon F_i \to X$ be the inclusions of the connected
  components of the fixed point locus. For $\phi \in H_{\bT}^*(X)$
  and working in $H^*_{\bT}(X)[(H^*_{\bT})^{-1}]$,
  \[ \int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT} \phi = \sum_i \int_{(F_i)_{\bT}/B\bT} \frac{\iota^* \phi}{e(NF_i)} \in \Frac(H^*_{\bT}). \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  From the identity $(\iota^{F_i})^* \iota^{F_i}_* 1 = e(NF_i)$ and
  the Atiyah--Bott theorem, we can invert $e(NF_i)$ and write $\phi =
  \sum_i \iota_*(\iota^* \phi/e(NF_i))$. We can apply $\pi^X_*$ to
  both sides. But $\pi^X_* \circ \iota^{F_i}_* = \pi^{F_i}_*$, i.e.
  integration over $F_i$. Hence
  \[ \int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT} \phi = \pi^X_*\phi = \sum_i \pi^{F_i}_* \frac{\iota^*\phi}{e(NF_i)} = \sum_i \int_{(F_i)_{\bT}/B\bT} \frac{\iota^*\phi}{e(NF_i)}. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

The idea is that the Atiyah--Bott localization formula simplifies many
equivariant cohomology integrals by letting us only calculate over
fixed points. It also allows us prove many fixed-point theorems. We do
one such theorem as an example of localization.

\begin{proposition}
  Let $\bT$ act on $X$ with fixed point locus $\bigcup_i F_i$. Then
  \[ \chi(X) = \sum_i \chi(F_i). \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  From the generalized Gauss--Bonnet theorem
  \ref{thm:generalized-gauss-bonnet} we know $\chi(X) = \int_X e(X)$.
  The key is that the action of $\bT$ on $X$ lifts to an action of
  $\bT$ on $TX$, so the same statement holds in equivariant cohomology
  with $\int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT}\colon H^*_{\bT}(X) \to H^*_{\bT}$ being
  integration over the fiber (or the wrong-way map $\pi^X_*$).
  Localizing,
  \[ \int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT} e(X) = \sum_i \int_{(F_i)_{\bT}/B\bT} \frac{\iota^* e(X)}{e(NF_i)}. \]
  Remember here $\iota\colon F_i \to X$ are inclusions. Recall that
  $e(X) = c_n(X)$ and note that there is an exact sequence of
  equivariant bundles $TF_i \to \iota^* TX \to NF_i$, so by
  naturality \ref{thm:chern-axioms} and the splitting principle,
  \[ \iota^* e(X) = \iota^* c_n(X) = c_n(\iota^* TX) = c_n(TF_i) c_n(NF_i). \]
  Hence when we plug this back into the localized expression,
  \[ \chi(X) = \int_{X_{\bT}/B\bT} e(X) = \sum_i \int_{(F_i)_{\bT}/B\bT} c_n(TF_i) = \sum_i \chi(F_i). \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\section{Calabi--Yau Manifolds}

In this section we develop the theory of Calabi--Yau manifolds, the
main objects of mirror symmetry.

\subsection{K\"ahler Geometry}

We briefly review K\"ahler geometry in this subsection. Let $X$ be a
complex $n$-fold with complex structure $J$ and coordinates $(z^1,
\ldots, z^n, \bz^1, \ldots, \bz^n)$. Let $g = g_{i\bar{j}}(z)$ be a
Hermitian metric on $X$.

\begin{definition}
  The $2$-form $\omega(X, Y) \coloneqq g(X, JY)$ is the {\bf
    associated K\"ahler form}. We say $g$ is a {\bf K\"ahler metric}
  and $(M, g)$ is a {\bf K\"ahler manifold} if $d\omega = 0$. In
  coordinates, if $g = g_{i\bar{j}}(z) dz^i \odot d\bz^{\bar{j}}$,
  then $\omega = (i/2)g_{i\bar{j}}(z) dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{j}}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:lefschetz-nonzero}
  The volume form associated to a Hermitian metric $g$ is equal to
  $\omega^n/n!$. Hence if $X$ is a closed K\"ahler manifold, $\omega^k
  \in H^{2k}_{\dR}(X)$ is non-zero for every $1 \le k \le n$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ be a complex orthonormal basis of $T_{X,x}$,
  so that the corresponding real basis is $e_1, Je_1, \ldots, e_n,
  Je_n$ and it suffices to check $(\omega^n/n!)(e_1 \wedge Je_1 \wedge
  \cdots \wedge e_n \wedge Je_n) = 1$. But this is obvious, since
  $\omega = (i/2)\sum_i dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{i}}$ in orthonormal
  coordinates.

  If $\omega^k = d\eta$, then $\omega^n = d(\omega^{n-k} \wedge \eta)$
  by the K\"ahler condition. By Stokes', $\int_X \omega^n = 0$ since
  $X$ is closed. But this is supposed to be the volume of $X$.
\end{proof}

So it is easy to give examples of non-K\"ahler complex manifolds: just
pick a closed complex $n$-fold whose $H^{2k}_{\dR}$ is zero for some
$1 \le k \le n$, e.g. Hopf surfaces.

\begin{definition}
  Let $E$ be a Hermitian vector bundle over $X$ with Hermitian metric
  $h$. A connection $\nabla$ on $E$ is {\bf compatible} with $h$ if
  \[ d(h(\sigma, \tau)) = h(\nabla \sigma, \tau) + h(\sigma, \nabla \tau). \]
  Here we define $h(\sigma \otimes \eta, \tau) \coloneqq h(\sigma,
  \tau) \eta$ where $\eta \in \Omega^*(X)$. But $h$ is sesquilinear,
  so $h(\sigma, \tau \otimes \eta) = h(\sigma, \tau) \overline{\eta}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle with holomorphic structure
  $\bdi_E$. Then there exists a unique connection $\nabla$ on $E$,
  called the {\bf Chern connection}, compatible with $h$ and with
  $\nabla^{0,1} = \bdi_E$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Writing down the $(1,0)$-part of the condition for compatibility, we
  get
  \[ \di(h(\sigma, \tau)) = h(\nabla^{1,0}\sigma, \tau) + h(\sigma, \nabla^{0,1}\tau) = h(\nabla^{1,0}\sigma, \tau) \]
  where the last equality follows from $\nabla^{0,1} = \bdi_E$ and
  $\sigma, \tau$ being holomorphic sections. Since $h$ is
  non-degenerate, this equality uniquely specifies $\nabla^{1,0}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 3.13, Proposition 3.14]{Voisin2002}}, {\cite[Proposition 4.A.17]{Huybrechts2005}}] \label{thm:kahler-defs}
  The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the metric $h$ is K\"ahler, i.e. $\di_i h_{j\bar{k}} = \di_j
    h_{i\bar{k}}$,
  \item the Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ of the Levi--Civita
    connection are {\bf pure}, i.e. $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ and
    $\Gamma^{\bar{i}}_{\bar{j}\bar{k}}$ may be non-zero, but ``mixed''
    symbols like $\Gamma^{\bar{i}}_{jk}$ vanish,
  \item the complex structure $J$ is {\bf parallel} with respect to
    the Levi--Civita connection of $h$, i.e. $\nabla J = 0$,
  \item the Chern connection and the Levi--Civita connection coincide,
  \item there exists {\bf normal coordinates} in a neighborhood of any
    $x \in X$, i.e. holomorphic coordinates $z_1, \ldots, z_n$ such
    that $h_{i\bar{j}} = \delta_{ij} + O(\sum_i |z_i|^2)$,
  \item $X$ is a $2n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy in
    $U(n)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  The K\"ahler condition $d\omega = 0$ implies that for any point $x
  \in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $U$ and a function
  $\Phi\colon U \to \bR$ on $U$ with $\omega|_U = (i/2)\di\bdi\Phi$.
  Namely, it suffices to pick the domain $U \cong \bC^n$ of a chart:
  by the $\bdi$-Poincar\'e lemma, $\omega$ is $\bdi$-exact on $U$, and
  then we apply the global $\di\bdi$-lemma \ref{thm:deldelbar-lemma}
  (which we shall use Hodge theory to prove in the next subsection).
  The function $\Phi$ is the {\bf K\"ahler potential}. Note that
  $\Phi$ is not uniquely determined: $\Phi + f(z) + g(\bz)$ defines
  the same $\omega$.
\end{definition}

The K\"ahler potential is local and cannot be defined globally! For if
$\omega = (i/2)\di\bdi\Phi$ globally, then $\omega$ is exact,
violating \ref{thm:lefschetz-nonzero}.

\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. The {\bf K\"ahler class} of
  a K\"ahler structure on $X$ is the cohomology class $[\omega] \in
  H^{1,1}(X)$ of its K\"ahler form. The {\bf K\"ahler cone}
  \[ \cK_X \subset H^{1,1}(X) \cap H^2(X, \bR) \]
  is the set of all K\"ahler classes associated to any K\"ahler
  structure on $X$. (Clearly $\cK_X$ is closed under positive
  rescaling, so this is indeed a cone.)
\end{definition}

Later when we look at deformations of Calabi--Yau manifolds, we shall
see that any class in $H^{1,1}(X)$ can be used to deform the metric
slightly. So $h^{1,1}$ classifies infinitesimal deformations of the
metric (c.f. \ref{thm:h11-kahler-deformation}).

\subsection{Hodge Theory of K\"ahler Manifolds}

We now look at the Hodge theory of K\"ahler manifolds, which is more
interesting than the Hodge theory of Riemannian manifolds. For
completeness we first review the Riemannian case.

\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ be a compact oriented Riemannian $n$-fold with Riemannian
  metric $g$. Define the {\bf $L^2$ inner product} on $\Omega^k(X)$ by
  $(\alpha, \beta)_{L^2} \coloneqq \int \alpha \wedge \star \beta$
  where $\star$ is the {\bf Hodge star}. The (formal) adjoint of the
  exterior derivative $d\colon \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^{k+1}(X)$ under
  $(\cdot, \cdot)_{L^2}$ is denoted $d^*\colon \Omega^{k+1}(X) \to
  \Omega^k(X)$ and called the {\bf codifferential}. A quick
  calculation shows $d^* = (-1)^{n(k-1)+1}\star d \star = (-1)^k
  \star^{-1} d \star$, which commutes with $d$. Define the space
  $\cH^k_\Delta(X)$ of {\bf harmonic forms} to be the kernel of the
       {\bf Laplacian} $\Delta$:
  \[ \cH^k_\Delta(X) \coloneqq \{\alpha \in \Omega^k(X) : \Delta \alpha = 0\}, \quad \Delta \coloneqq dd^* + d^*d\colon \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^k(X). \]
  The {\bf Hodge decomposition} is an orthogonal decomposition (with
  respect to the $L^2$ inner product)
  \[ \Omega^k(X) \cong \im(\Omega^{k-1} \xrightarrow{d} \Omega^k) \oplus \im(\Omega^{k+1} \xrightarrow{d^*} \Omega^k) \oplus \cH^k_{\Delta}. \]
  Since $d^*$ and therefore $\Delta$ commutes with $d$, we have
  $d\cH^k_\Delta = 0$, so there is a canonical map $\varphi\colon
  \cH^k_\Delta(X) \to H^k_{\dR}(X)$. The {\bf Hodge theorem} says
  $\varphi$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces, i.e. every cohomology
  class has a unique harmonic representative.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  For $X$ a complex manifold now with a Hermitian metric, $d = \di +
  \bdi$. Denoting the $L^2$ adjoint of $\di$ and $\bdi$ by $\di^*$ and
  $\bdi^*$ respectively, define the {\bf $\bdi$-laplacian}
  $\Delta_{\bdi} \coloneqq \bdi \bdi^* + \bdi^* \bdi$ and similarly
  for the $\di$-laplacian. Similarly if $E$ is a holomorphic vector
  bundle with holomorphic structure $\bdi_E$ then $\Delta_E \coloneqq
  \bdi_E \bdi_E^* + \bdi_E^* \bdi_E$. Define the {\bf $\bdi$-harmonic
    forms}
  \[ \cH^{p,q}_{\bdi}(X) \coloneqq \{\alpha \in \Omega^{p,q}(X) : \Delta_{\bdi}\alpha = 0\} \]
  and similarly for {\bf $\di$-harmonic forms}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} \label{thm:harmonic-implies-closed}
  Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold with Hermitian metric. Then
  $\alpha$ is $\bdi$-harmonic iff $\alpha$ is both $\bdi$- and
  $\bdi^*$-closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Note that $(\Delta_{\bdi}\alpha, \alpha) = \|\bdi^*\alpha\|^2 +
  \|\bdi\alpha\|^2 = 0$ implies $\bdi^*\alpha = \bdi\alpha = 0$. The
  converse is trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\omega$ be the associated K\"ahler form. The {\bf Lefschetz
    operator} $L\colon \Omega^{p,q} \to \Omega^{p+1,q+1}$ is given by
  $\alpha \mapsto \alpha \wedge \omega$. The {\bf dual Lefschetz
    operator} $\Lambda\colon \Omega^{p+1,q+1} \to \Omega^{p,q}$ is the
  $L^2$ adjoint of the Lefschetz operator $L$. Note that by
  \ref{thm:lefschetz-nonzero}, $L^k \neq 0$ for $1 \le k \le n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[K\"ahler identities, {\cite[Section 6.1]{Voisin2002}}] \label{thm:kahler-identities}
  If $(X, h)$ is a K\"ahler manifold, then
  \[ [\bdi^*, L] = i\di, \quad \bdi^* \di + \di \bdi^* = 0, \quad \Delta_d = 2\Delta_\di = 2\Delta_{\bdi}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  Bash the first equation out locally in $\bC$, and then use
  (holomorphic) normal coordinates to put it onto $X$. Then bash some
  more for the other two equations.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:harmonic-components}
  If $\alpha \in \Omega^k$ is harmonic, then its components
  $\alpha^{p,q} \in \Omega^{p,q}$ are harmonic.
\end{corollary}

Note that by the K\"ahler identities, we do not need to specify the
Laplacian with respect to which a form is harmonic. In particular,
$(p,q)$-forms harmonic for $\Delta_d$ are also harmonic for
$\Delta_{\bdi}$.

\begin{theorem}[Hodge decomposition, {\cite[Theorem 3.2.8]{Huybrechts2005}}] \label{thm:hodge-decomposition}
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. There exists orthogonal {\bf
    Hodge decompositions}
  \[ \Omega^{p,q} = \di \Omega^{p-1,q} \oplus \di^* \Omega^{p+1,q} \oplus \cH^{p,q}_{\di} = \bdi \Omega^{p,q-1} \oplus \bdi^* \Omega^{p,q+1} \oplus \cH^{p,q}_{\bdi}. \]
  Furthermore $\cH^{p,q}_{\di} = \cH^{p,q}_{\bdi}$, and the canonical
  projection $\cH^{p,q}_{\bdi} \to H^{p,q}(X, \bC)$ given by
  \ref{thm:harmonic-implies-closed} is an isomorphism. Hence by
  \ref{thm:harmonic-components}, $H^k(X, \bC) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}
  H^{p,q}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  The odd Betti numbers $b_{2k+1} \coloneqq \dim_{\bC} H^{2k+1}(X,
  \bC)$ of a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ are even.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Complex conjugation acts naturally on $H^{p+q}(X, \bC)$ with
  $\overline{H^{p,q}} = H^{q,p}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Global $\di\bdi$ lemma, {\cite[Corollary 3.2.10]{Huybrechts2005}}] \label{thm:deldelbar-lemma}
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. If $\alpha \in
  \Omega^{p,q}(X)$ and $d\alpha = 0$ then
  \[ \alpha \text{ is } d\text{-exact} \iff \alpha \text{ is } \di\text{-exact} \iff \alpha \text{ is } \di\bdi\text{-exact} \iff \alpha \text{ is } \di\bdi\text{-exact}. \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By the Hodge decomposition theorem \ref{thm:hodge-decomposition},
  any of the four conditions above implies $\alpha$ is orthogonal to
  $\cH^{p,q}$ (where since $X$ is K\"ahler we do not need to specify
  which Laplacian we are considering for harmonicity). We shall show
  this implies $\alpha$ is $\di\bdi$-exact.

  Since $\alpha$ is $d$-closed and therefore $\di$-closed, $(\di
  \alpha, \beta) = (\alpha, \di^*\beta) = 0$, so $\alpha$ is also
  orthogonal to $\di^*\Omega^{p+1,q}$. By the Hodge decomposition with
  respect to $\di$, it follows that $\alpha \in \di\Omega^{p-1,q}$,
  i.e. $\alpha = \di \gamma$ for some $\gamma \in \Omega^{p-1,q}$. By
  Hodge decomposition with respect to $\bdi$ on $\gamma$,
  \[ \gamma = \bdi\beta + \bdi^*\beta' + \beta'', \quad \alpha = \di\gamma = \di\bdi\beta + \di\bdi^*\beta' \]
  where \ref{thm:harmonic-implies-closed} implies that $\di\beta'' =
  0$. We use the K\"ahler identity $\di\bdi^* = -\bdi^*\di$ from
  \ref{thm:kahler-identities} to get
  \[ 0 = \bdi\alpha = \bdi\di\bdi\beta + \bdi\di\bdi^*\beta' = 0 - \bdi\bdi^*\di\beta'. \]
  But $0 = (\bdi\bdi^*\di\beta', \di\beta') = \|\bdi^*\di\beta'\|^2$,
  so the term $\di\bdi^*\beta'$ in $\alpha$ vanishes and we are left
  with $\alpha = \di\bdi\beta$.
\end{proof}

There is a different orthogonal decomposition of cohomology that is
useful in computations. This decomposition arises from the Lefschetz
operator $L$ rather than Hodge theory.

\begin{theorem}[Hard Lefschetz theorem, {\cite[Theorem 6.25]{Voisin2002}}]
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. For $k \le n$, the
  $(n-k)$-th power of the Lefschetz operator gives an isomorphism
  \[ L^{n-k}\colon H^k(X, \bC) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^{2n-k}(X, \bC). \]
  Equivalently, since $\omega$ is a $(1,1)$-form, $H^{p,q}(X, \bC)
  \cong H^{n-q,n-p}(X, \bC)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, {\cite[Theorem 1.23]{Voisin2003}}] \label{thm:lefschetz-hyperplane}
  Let $X \subseteq \bP^N$ be a (not necessarily smooth)
  $n$-dimensional algebraic subvariety, and $Y = \bP^{N-1} \cap X$ be
  a hyperplane section such that $X \setminus Y$ is smooth. Then the
  restriction $H^k(X, \bZ) \to H^k(Y, \bZ)$ is an isomorphism for $k <
  n-1$ and injective for $k = n-1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Lefschetz decomposition, {\cite[Corollary 6.26, Lemma 6.31]{Voisin2002}}]
  Writing $H^r(X, \bC)_{\text{prim}} \coloneqq \ker L^{n-r+1} \subset
  H^r(X, \bC)$ for the {\bf primitive forms}, we have the (orthogonal
  with respect to the $L^2$ inner product) Lefschetz decomposition
  \[ H^k(X, \bC) \cong \bigoplus_{k-2r \ge 0} L^r H^{k-2r}(X, \bC)_{\text{prim}}. \]
\end{theorem}

The {\bf Hodge diamond} is the collection of Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$
arranged in a diamond with rows of increasing $p+q$. Its symmetries
for a compact K\"ahler manifold are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item reflection across the vertical axis $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$, from
  complex conjugation;
\item reflection across the horizontal axis $h^{p,q} = h^{n-q,n-p}$,
  from the Hodge star or the hard Lefschetz theorem;
\item $180^{\circ}$ rotation $h^{p,q} = h^{n-p,n-q}$, from Serre duality;
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calabi--Yau Manifolds}

Throughout this subsection, $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold with
all the notation of the previous subsections, and also with
Levi--Civita connection $\nabla$. We use $\nabla^K$ to denote the
induced connection on the canonical bundle $K_X \coloneqq
\Lambda^{n,0}X$.

\begin{definition}
  Recall the {\bf Riemann curvature tensor} and {\bf Ricci curvature
    tensor}
  \[ R(X,Y)Z \coloneqq \nabla_X\nabla_YZ - \nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z, \quad \Ric(X,Y) \coloneqq \tr(Z \mapsto R(Z,X)Y). \]
  In coordinates, if ${R^l}_{ijk}$ is the Riemann curvature tensor,
  then $R_{ij}\coloneqq {R^k}_{ikj}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor. By
  \ref{thm:kahler-defs}, $\nabla J = 0$, so $R(X,Y)JZ = JR(X,Y)Z$,
  which gives $\Ric(JX, JY) = \Ric(X, Y)$ after some work. Hence
  $\Ric(JX, Y)$ is skew-symmetric in $X$ and $Y$. The {\bf Ricci form}
  $\rho$ of $X$ is defined by $\rho(X, Y)\coloneqq \Ric(JX, Y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 12.2]{Moroianu2007}}] \label{thm:ricci-form-closed}
  The Ricci tensor of a K\"ahler manifold satisfies
  \[ \Ric(X, Y) = (1/2)\tr(R(X, JY) \circ J). \]
  It follows that the Ricci form $\rho$ is $d$-closed.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  The identity for the Ricci tensor is just a short calculation using
  the first Bianchi identity $R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,Z)X + R(Z,X)Y = 0$. Then
  \[ 2d\rho(X, Y, Z) = 2((\nabla_X \rho)(Y, Z) + \text{cyclic perms}) = \tr(((\nabla_X R)(Y, Z) + \text{cyclic perms}) \circ J) = 0 \]
  by the second Bianchi identity $(\nabla_X R)(Y, Z) + \text{cyclic
    perms} = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 17.4]{Moroianu2007}}] \label{thm:chern-curvature-is-ricci}
  Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold. Then $c_1(X) = (1/2\pi)[\tr \rho]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  By Chern--Weil, $c_1(X) = -c_1(K_X)$. Let $F_\nabla$ be the
  curvature operator $F_\nabla \in \Gamma(\Lambda^2 X
  \otimes \End(TX))$ of the Chern connection on $X$ and $R$ be the
  Riemannian curvature tensor of the Levi--Civita connection on $X$.
  Then a straightforward calculation shows $F_\nabla(X,Y) = R(X,Y)$ on
  $TX$. Writing $\nabla^K$ for the induced connection on $K_X$, we
  have $F_{\nabla^K} = \tr F_\nabla = \tr R$. But then using
  \ref{thm:ricci-form-closed},
  \[ i\rho(X, Y) = i\Ric(JX, Y) = \frac{i}{2} \tr_{\bR}(R(X, Y) \circ J) = \frac{i}{2}(2i \tr_{\bC}(R(X, Y))) = -\tr_{\bC}(R(X, Y)) = F_{\nabla^K}(X, Y). \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 17.5]{Moroianu2007}}] \label{def:calabi-yau}
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. The following are
  equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $X$ is Ricci-flat, i.e. $\Ric = 0$,
  \item the Chern connection of the canonical bundle $K_X$ is flat,
  \item there exists a (local) section of the canonical bundle
    parallel to the Levi--Civita connection $\nabla$,
  \item $X$ has holonomy in $\SU(n)$,
  \end{enumerate}
  If $X$ satisfies any of these conditions, we say $X$ is a {\bf
    Calabi--Yau manifold}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  $(2) \iff (4)$ Let $\nabla$ be the Levi--Civita connection on
  $X$. The holonomy of the induced connection $\nabla^K$ on $K_X$
  satisfies $\Hol_0(\nabla^K) = \det(\Hol_0(\nabla))$, so
  $\Hol_0(\nabla^K) = \{1\}$ iff the original holonomy is in $\SU(n)$.
  By the Ambrose--Singer theorem, $\Hol_0(\nabla^K = \{1\}$ iff
  $\nabla^K$ is flat.

  $(2) \iff (1)$ By \ref{thm:chern-curvature-is-ricci}, the vanishing
  of the curvature of $\nabla^K$ is equivalent to the vanishing of
  $\rho$.

  $(2) \iff (3)$ This is the general principle that a connection on a
  line bundle is flat iff there exists a (locally defined) parallel
  section (which is global if $\pi_1(X) = 0$).
\end{proof}

Note that by \ref{thm:chern-curvature-is-ricci}, $c_1(X) = 0$ is a
necessary condition for there to be a Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric on
$X$. The following deep theorem of Calabi and Yau shows this condition
is also sufficient when $X$ is compact, i.e. $c_1$ is the only
topological obstruction.

\begin{theorem}[Calabi--Yau, {\cite[Theorem 18.1]{Moroianu2007}}]
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold with K\"ahler form $\omega$
  and Ricci form $\rho$. For every $\rho_1$ in the cohomology class of
  $2\pi c_1(X) \in H^{1,1}(X) \cap H^2(X, \bR)$, there exists a unique
  K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler form $\omega_1$ in the cohomology
  class of $\omega$ and with Ricci form $\rho_1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:h11-kahler-deformation}
  Let $M$ be a compact complex manifold with $c_1(X) = 0 \in
  H^{1,1}(X) \cap H^2(X, \bR)$. Then there is a unique Ricci-flat
  K\"ahler metric in each K\"ahler class on $X$. The family of
  Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on $X$ is therefore isomorphic to the
  K\"ahler cone of $X$.
\end{corollary}

The Hodge numbers of Calabi--Yau manifolds are special. Since the
canonical bundle $K_X$ of a Calabi--Yau manifold $X$ is trivial, it is
generated by a nowhere-vanishing global holomorphic $(n,0)$-form $f(z)
dz^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz^n$. But $M$ is compact, so $f$ is
therefore constant, and $h^{n,0} = 1$. By the symmetries of the Hodge
diamond for K\"ahler manifolds, $h^{n,0} = h^{0,n} = h^{0,0} = h^{n,n}
= 1$.

\begin{proposition}
  Let $X$ be Calabi--Yau. If $\chi(X) \neq 0$, then $b_1 = 0$,
  i.e. $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to find $b_1$ for the Ricci-flat metric since $b_1$ is a
  topological invariant. Let $\alpha$ be a harmonic $1$-form. The
  Weitzenb\"ock formula says $\Delta \alpha = \nabla^*\nabla\alpha +
  \tilde{R}\alpha$ where $\tilde{R}$ depends only on the curvature.
  Hence $\nabla^*\nabla\alpha = 0$, which when integrated by parts
  gives $\nabla\alpha = 0$. In other words, $\alpha$ is constant. But
  $\chi(X) \neq 0$, so $\alpha$ must have a zero somewhere (c.f.
  \ref{thm:euler-dual}). Hence $\alpha = 0$. By the Hodge theorem
  \ref{thm:hodge-decomposition}, $H^1 = \cH^1_{\Delta} = 0$.
\end{proof}

We are generally interested in Calabi--Yau $3$-folds. It follows by
the discussion above that the Hodge diamond of Calabi--Yau $3$-folds
is almost fully determined:
\[ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
  & && 1 && & \\
  && 0 && 0 && \\
  & 0 && h^{1,1} && 0 & \\
  1 && h^{2,1} && h^{2,1} && 1 \\
  & 0 && h^{1,1} && 0 & \\
  && 0 && 0 && \\
  & && 1 && & \\
\end{array} \]
By \ref{thm:h11-kahler-deformation}, we interpret $h^{1,1}$ as the
number of linearly independent infinitesimal deformations of the
K\"ahler structure of $X$. The next subsection interprets $h^{2,1}$.

\subsection{Calabi--Yau Moduli Space}

In this subsection we explore the moduli space of Calabi--Yau
manifolds following \cite{Candelas1991}. A lot of bashing is omitted.

Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau $3$-fold with (holomorphically) trivial
canonical bundle $K_X$. ({\bf Note}: this is stronger than just being
Calabi--Yau according to our definition \ref{def:calabi-yau}, and is
our setting from now on). Let $g$ and $g + \delta g$ be two Ricci-flat
metrics. Then, working in the gauge $\nabla^j g_{ij} = 0$, some work
shows
\[ \Ric(g + \delta g) = 0 + O((\delta g)^2) \implies \nabla^a\nabla_a\delta g_{ij} + 2R_i{}^a{}_j{}^b \delta g_{ab} = 0, \]

\begin{definition}
  The equation $\nabla^a\nabla_a\delta g_{ij} + 2R_i{}^a{}_j{}^b
  \delta g_{ab} = 0$ is called the {\bf Lichnerowicz equation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  The solutions of the Lichnerowicz equation are in one-to-one
  correspondence with $H^{1,1}(X) \oplus H^{2,1}(X)$, where $H^{1,1}$
  corresponds to variations of K\"ahler structure, and $H^{2,1}$
  corresponds to variations of complex structure.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Since $X$ is Kahler, \ref{thm:kahler-defs} tells us the Christoffel
  symbols are ``pure'', i.e. only $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ and
  $\Gamma^{\bar{i}}_{\bar{j}\bar{k}}$ are nonzero, and other symbols
  with mixed indices are zero. This fact and some more work then shows
  that $\delta g_{i\bar{j}}$, which we call variations of {\bf mixed
    type}, and $\delta g_{ij}$, which we call variations of {\bf pure
    type}, individually satisfy the Lichnerowicz equation.

  Let $\Omega_{abc} \in H^{3,0}$ be the preferred holomorphic
  $(3,0)$-form. Both types of variations can be associated to forms:
  \[ i\delta g_{i\bar{j}} dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{j}} \in H^{1,1}(X, \bR), \quad \Omega_{ab}{}^{\bar{j}} \delta g_{\bar{i}\bar{j}} dz^a \wedge dz^b \wedge d\bz^{\bar{i}} \in H^{2,1}(X, \bR). \]
  Using a Weitzenb\"ock formula, these forms are harmonic iff their
  associated variations $g_{i\bar{j}}$ and $g_{ij}$ satisfy the
  Lichnerowicz equation.

  The mixed variation $\delta g_{i\bar{j}}$ gives a new K\"ahler form
  since $i \delta g_{i\bar{j}} dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{j}}$ is harmonic
  and therefore $d$-closed:
  \[ \tilde{\omega} \coloneqq i(g_{i\bar{j}} + \delta g_{i\bar{j}}) dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{j}} = \omega + i\delta g_{i\bar{j}} dz^i \wedge d\bz^{\bar{j}}. \]
  The pure variation $\delta g_{ij}$ gives a new metric
  $\tilde{g}_{ij} = g_{ij} + \delta g_{ij}$. We want the pure indices
  to vanish in some new coordinate system $x^i \mapsto x'^i \coloneqq
  x^i + f^i(x)$, where
  \[ \tilde{g}_{ij}' = \tilde{g}_{ij} - (\di_i f^k) g_{kj} - (\di_j f^k) g_{ik}. \]
  Hence $\delta g_{\bar{i}\bar{j}} - (\di_{\bar{i}} f^k) g_{k\bar{j}}
  - (\di_{\bar{j}} f^k)g_{\bar{i}k} = 0$. Since $\delta
  g_{\bar{i}\bar{j}} \neq 0$ is our variation, $f$ cannot be
  holomorphic. So pure variations change the complex structure.
\end{proof}

It is not surprising that pure variations, represented by
$H^{2,1}(X)$, correspond to variations in complex structure:
Kodaira--Spencer deformation theory tells us infinitesimal
deformations of complex structure for a compact complex manifold are
represented by $H^1(TX)$ \cite[Section 9.1.2]{Voisin2002}, and for
Calabi--Yau manifolds we have the identification $H^1(TX) \cong
H^1(\Lambda^2 T^*X) = H^{2,1}(X)$ via the pairing $\wedge\colon TM
\otimes \Lambda^2 TM \to \Lambda^3TM = 1$.

\begin{theorem}[Tian--Todorov, \cite{Tian1987}]
  Deformations of Calabi--Yau manifolds is {\bf unobstructed}, i.e.
  every infinitesimal deformation of a Calabi--Yau manifold lifts to
  an actual deformation. In particular, the family of Ricci-flat
  K\"ahler metrics, i.e. the K\"ahler cone, is smooth of dimension
  $h^{1,1}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  We saw in \ref{ex:quintic-hypersurface-chern-class} that the first
  Chern class $c_1(Q)$ of the quintic hypersurface $Q$ in $\bP^4$
  vanishes, so $Q$ can be given a Calabi--Yau structure. By the
  Lefschetz hyperplane theorem \ref{thm:lefschetz-hyperplane},
  $h^{1,1}(Q) = h^{1,1}(\bP^4)$, which is just $1$ since the
  cohomology ring of $\bP^N$ is generated by $x$, a generic
  hyperplane. We also know $\chi(Q) = -200$, but from the Hodge
  diamond of Calabi--Yau manifolds we see $\chi(Q) = 2(h^{1,1}(Q) -
  h^{1,2}(Q))$. Hence $h^{1,2}(Q) = 101$.

  A quick sanity check for $h^{1,2}(Q) = 101$ goes as follows. From
  \ref{ex:quintics-dim}, there are $126$ ways to deform the defining
  equation for $Q$ inside $\cO_{\bP^4}(5)$. One of these vanishes on
  $Q$, being $Q$ itself. So there are $125$ infinitesimal deformations
  of complex structure, but $\bP^4$ has automorphism group $\PGL(5)$,
  which is of dimension $5^2 - 1$, leaving $125 - 24 = 101$ distinct
  deformations.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf moduli space of complex structures} for the Calabi--Yau
  $3$-fold $X$ is denoted $\cM_X$. We write $X_z$ for the Calabi--Yau
  $3$-fold at $z$ in $\cM_X$ and set $X_0 \coloneqq X$. (The
  coordinates $z$ are coming up soon.)
\end{definition}

We now look at the structure of the moduli space of complex structures
$\cM_X$, by investigating how the generating $(3,0)$-form $\Omega
\coloneqq (1/3!)\Omega_{ijk} dz^i \wedge dz^j \wedge dz^k$ of $X$
moves inside $H^{3,0}(X)$ as we move around in $\cM_X$. First we need
to define coordinates on $\cM_X$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $(A^a, B_b)$ with $a, b = 0, 1, \ldots, h^{2,1}$ be a symplectic
  homology basis of $H_3(X)$, i.e. under the intersection pairing,
  $\inner{A^a, B_b} = \delta^a_b$. Let $(\alpha_a, \beta^b)$ the
  Poincar\'e dual cohomology basis. (Such a basis is unique up to a
  $\Sp(b_3, \bZ)$ transformation, i.e. up to preservation of the
  intersection form that defines Poincar\'e duality.) Writing $\Omega
  = z^a \alpha_a - w_b \beta^b$, we have $z^a = \int_{A^a} \Omega$ and
  $w_b = \int_{B_b} \Omega$, called the {\bf periods} of $\Omega$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bryant--Griffiths, \cite{Bryant1983}]
  Locally, $\{z^a\}$ is sufficient to determine the complex structure
  of $X$, and the $\{w_b\}$ are redundant, i.e. they can be computed
  as functions of $z^a$.
\end{theorem}

The $\{z^a\}$ are {\bf projective coordinates}, since under $\Omega
\mapsto \lambda \Omega$ they scale as $z^a \mapsto \lambda z^a$, but
we only care about $\Omega$ up to scalar multiples. So we view $(z^0,
\ldots, z^{h^{2,1}}) \in \bP^{h^{2,1}}$, and the scaling $\Omega
\mapsto e^{f(z)}\Omega$ is a gauge redundancy. ({\bf Note}: we use $a,
b, c$ to index coordinates on the moduli space, and $i, j, k$ to index
coordinates on each $X_z$.)

\begin{definition}
  The {\bf Hodge bundle} $\cH$ is the bundle over $\cM_X$ with fiber
  $H^3(X_z; \bC)$ at the point $z \in \cM_X$. On $\cH$, the
  intersection pairing $(\theta, \eta) = i\int_{X_z} \theta \wedge
  \bar{\eta}$ provides a natural Hermitian metric. There is a natural
  flat connection on $\cH$ called the {\bf Gauss--Manin connection}.
  (We shall see it in more detail later when we discuss the $tt^*$
  equations.) The $3$-form $\Omega$ (and its scalar multiples) defines
  the {\bf vacuum line bundle} inside the Hodge bundle $\cH$. The
  intersection pairing on $\cH$ induces an $h \coloneqq i\int_{X_z}
  \Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega}$. Note that under $\Omega \mapsto
  e^{f(z)} \Omega$, the quantity $h$ transforms as $h \mapsto h e^f
  e^{\bar{f}}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  On $\cM_X$, fix local affine coordinates $\{t^a\}$ with $a=1,
  \ldots, h^{2,1}$. The {\bf K\"ahler potential} $K$ on $\cM_X$ is
  given by
  \[ K \coloneqq -\log \int_X \Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega}, \]
  which does indeed transform as a K\"ahler potential: under $\Omega
  \mapsto e^{f(z)} \Omega$, we have $K \mapsto K - f - \bar{f}$,
  defining the same K\"ahler form. The {\bf Weil--Petersson metric} on
  $\cM_X$ is the metric associated to the K\"ahler potential:
  $g_{a\bar{b}} \coloneqq \di_a \bdi_{\bar{b}} K$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Griffiths transversality] \label{thm:griffiths-transversality}
  The variation $\di_a\Omega$ of $\Omega$ with respect to the
  coordinate $z^a$ satisfies
  \[ \di_a\Omega = k_a \Omega + \chi_a \in H^{3,0}(X_z) \oplus H^{2,1}(X_z) \]
  where $k_a$ may depend on $z^a$ but not on the coordinates
  of $X_z$. Consequently $\int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge \di_a\Omega = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\zeta^i(x, z)$ be a system of holomorphic coordinates on $X_z$
  varying with $z$, with $\zeta^i(x, 0) = x^i$, the original
  coordinates on $X_0$. Then $\Omega = (1/3!) \Omega_{ijk}(\zeta)
  d\zeta^i \wedge d\zeta^j \wedge d\zeta^k$, and
  \[ \di_a\Omega = \frac{1}{3!} \di_a \Omega_{ijk} d\zeta^i \wedge d\zeta^j \wedge d\zeta^k + \frac{1}{2!} \Omega_{ijk} d\zeta^i \wedge d\zeta^j \wedge \di_a(d\zeta^k). \]
  Clearly $d\zeta^k$ is a $(1,0)$-form with respect to the complex
  structure at $z^a$. With a variation of complex structure, it
  moves into $H^{1,0}(X_z) \oplus H^{0,1}(X_z)$. Hence
  $\di_a\Omega \in \Omega^{3,0}(X_z) \oplus \Omega^{2,1}(X_z)$.
  Since $d$ is independent of complex structure, $\di_a\Omega$ is
  still $d$-closed, and therefore in $H^{3,0}(X_z) \oplus
  H^{2,1}(X_z)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  If $\Omega = z^a \alpha_a - w_b \beta^b$ in the symplectic
  cohomology basis $(\alpha_a, \beta^b)$, then $2w_c = \di_c(z^a
  w_a)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By Griffiths transversality, $\int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge \di_c\Omega =
  0$. Writing this out in coordinates,
  \[ (z^a \alpha_a - w_b \beta^b, \alpha_c - \di_c w_b \beta^b) = w_c - z^a \di_c w_a = 0. \]
  Then $w_c = z^a \di_c w_a = \di_c(z^a w_a) - w_c$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Define the {\bf prepotential} $\cG \coloneqq z^aw_a$. Since $2w_c =
  \di_c\cG$, summing with $z^c$ on both sides gives $z^c \di_c \cG =
  2\cG$, so $\cG$ is homogeneous of degree $2$ in the $z^a$. The
  prepotential $\cG$ fully specifies the K\"ahler structure of $\cM_X$
  by
  \[ i \int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega} = i(\bz^a \di_a \cG - z^a \bdi_a \bar{\cG}). \]
  We call a K\"ahler structure with holomorphic prepotential {\bf
    special K\"ahler}. The prepotential encodes all the important data
  for mirror symmetry and is quite an important object!
\end{definition}

It may be useful at this point to get used to all these new objects by
verifying the following useful formulas. Writing $\di_a\Omega = k_a
\Omega + \chi_a$, we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g_{a\bar{b}} = -ie^K \int_{X_z} \chi_a \wedge \bar{\chi}_{\bar{b}}$;
\item $k_a = -\di_a K$, the K\"ahler potential.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proposition}
  By the same arguments as for Griffiths transversality in
  \ref{thm:griffiths-transversality},
  \[ \di_a \di_b \Omega \in H^{3,0} \oplus H^{2,1} \oplus H^{2,1}, \quad \int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge \di_a\di_b\Omega = 0, \quad \int_{X_z} \di_a \Omega \wedge \di_b \Omega = 0. \]
  However these equalities give no new relations on the prepotential
  $\cG$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
  Note that the same argument fails for $\di_a\di_b\di_c\Omega$. The
  {\bf Yukawa coupling}
  \[ \kappa_{abc} \coloneqq -\int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge \di_a\di_b\di_c\Omega = \di_a\di_b\di_c\cG \]
  is in general non-zero.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Identify $\chi_a \in H^{2,1}(X_z)$ in the expansion $\di_a\Omega =
  k_a \Omega + \chi_a$ with $\chi_a^i \in H^1(TX_z) \cong
  H^{2,1}(X_z)$. Then
  \[ \kappa_{abc} = -\int_{X_z} \Omega \wedge (\Omega_{ijk} \chi^i_a \wedge \chi^j_b \wedge \chi^k_c). \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Note that, up to the identification $H^1(TX_z) \cong H^{2,1}(X_z)$,
  the form $\chi_a \wedge \chi_b \wedge \chi_c$ is precisely the
  $(0,3)$-component of $\di_a\di_b\di_c\Omega$ by Griffiths
  transversality \ref{thm:griffiths-transversality}. The
  identification, however, is easily worked out as $\chi_a^i =
  (1/2\|\Omega\|^2) \bar{\Omega}^{ijk}(\chi_a)_{ij\bar{k}}
  d\bar{z}^{\bar{k}}$. (Note here $\bar{z}^{\bar{k}}$ is a coordinate
  on $X_z$, not a moduli space coordinate.)
\end{proof}

\todo{Make a shorter introduction.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose Manifold $(M,g)$ with or without boundary. If with, then
        specify additional data. $g$ may be Riemannian or Lorentzian.
    \item \textbf{Objects:} fields. Here are some examples:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Gauge fields: connections over a principal bundle over $M$.
        \item Matter fields: sections of a vector bundle over $M$.
        \end{itemize}
        A \textbf{quantum gauge theory} has fields which are sections of
        associated vector bundles.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Sigma-model fields: $\phi\colon M \to X$, for some target
            manifold $X$.
        \end{itemize}
        A \textbf{quantum gravity theory} is obtained by integrating over
        various choices of metrics on $M$.
    \item The \textbf{action} allows us to define the path-integral by
        weighting the fields with $e^{-S}$ or $e^{iS}$ depending on whether
        or not $M$ is Riemannian or Lorentzian.
    \item Boundaries. If $\di M = \bigcup_i B_i$ then the set of field
        configurations on the boundary give rise to Hilbert spaces: $\mc
        H_i$. 
        The path integral can be viewed as a map $\bigotimes_i\mc H_i\to
        \bC$.
    \item Boundaries (evolution).
        Suppose $M=N\times [0,t]$ where $\di N = \varnothing$.
        This corresponds to a multi-linear map $\mc H^*\ten\mc H\to\bC$ or
        equivalently a linear map $U(t):\mc H\to \mc H$. Moreover, by
        gluing two manifolds together we get the following relation:
        \[ U(t_1+t_2)=U(t_1)U(t_2).\] By a theorem from functional analysis
        there exists a Hermitian operator $H$, which we call the
        Hamiltonian, which is given by $U(t) = e^{-tH}$ or $U(t) =
        e^{-itH}$ in the Euclidean or Minkowski case, respectively.
    \item Dimensionality.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Kaluza--Klein reduction is one way to acheive the
                effective 4-dimensional space-time that we see.
            \item Damping non-constant modes with action $e^{-S}$ effective
                path integral on the larger component.

                ``Luckily for us, the study of mirror symmetry entails
                studying QFTs with $d=2$, so our aim is to study mainly

\section{QFT with \texorpdfstring{$d=0$}{d=0}}
First, let us discuss the fields. For a real-valued theory with $\dim M=0$, 
we may identify functions $X:M\to\bR$ with just an element $X\in\bR$. To
model fermions we shall ask our variables to anti-commute:
$\psi_i\psi_j=-\psi_j\psi_i$.

The path-integral, or what Hori et al. calls the \textbf{partition
function}, is given by the expression \[Z \coloneqq \int e^{-S[X,\psi]}dX
d\psi.\] Whether it's for correlation appearing in statistical mechanics or
scattering amplitudes, many physical quantities can be expressed in terms
of \textbf{correlation functions}. Using the path integral approach, a
correlation function is an expectation value of an operator weighted by
$e^{-S}$: \[\braket{F(X,\psi)} = \int F(X,\psi) e^{-S}  dXd\psi.\] Let's be
clever. For the moment, assume that $F$ is a polynomial in $X$ and $\psi$.
Modifying the argument of the exponential $\exp(-S + J_1X+J_2\psi)$ and
applying the correct number of derivatives we can write:
\[ \braket{F} = \FR{\di}{\di J_1}\FR{\di}{\di J_2}\cdots
\biggr|_{J_1=J_2=0} \left(\int e^{-S+J_1X+J_2\psi}\, dXd\psi\right). \]
The integral on the right side may be denoted by $Z[X,\psi;J_1,J_2]$.

\subsection{Supersymmetry}

Supersymmetry is both mathematically and physically a useful tool. From a
mathematical point of view, ``the classical field equations have
non-trivial odd symmetries: eg. gradient flow lines in Morse theory,
holomorphic curves, gauge theory instantons, monopoles, Seiberg--Witten
solutions, hyperKahler structures, Calabi-Yau metrics, metrics of G2 and
Spin7 holonomy.'' From a physical point of view, ``[supersymmetric]
theories offer a possible way of solving the 'hierarchy problem,' the
mystery of the enormous ratio of the Planck mass to the 300 GeV energy
scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. Supersymmetry also has the quality
of uniqueness that we search for in fundamental physical theories. There is
an infinite number of Lie groups that can be used to combine particles of
the same spin in ordinary symmetry multiplets, but there are only eight
kinds of supersymmetry in four spacetime dimensions, of which only one, the
simplest, could be directly relevant to observed particles.'' \todo{Revamp
this introduction.}


Let us consider a simple QFT with one bosonic field $X$ and two fermionic
fields $\psi_1,\psi_2$ with an equally simple action: 
\begin{align} S = S_0(X) - \psi_1\psi_2 S_1(X).
    \label{susy-simple-action}
\end{align}
Taylor expanding the path-integral, and using the fermionic path-integral
rules (\ref{fermionic-path-integral-rules}), we get the following
expression for the integral: \[ \int e^{-S_0(X)+\psi_1\psi_2S_1(X)}
dXd\psi_1d\psi_2 = \int e^{-S_0}S_1(X).\]
For the rest of the section, we are going to pick a convenient choice for
the functions $S_0(X), S_1(X)$ so that we get a feeling for what a
supersymmetric theories have to offer. Fix a function $h:\bR\to \bR$, and let
\[ S_0(X) = \FR{1}{2} (\di h)^2, \qquad\qquad S_1(X) = \di^2 h.\] We use
the notation $\di h = h'(X)$ to refer to the derivative of $h$.  Together
with the form of the action \eqref{susy-simple-action}, we get a theory
that is invariant under the transformations:
\begin{align}
\delta X = \epsilon^1\psi_1 + \epsilon^2\psi_2,
\qquad \delta\psi_1 = \epsilon^2\di h,
\qquad \delta\psi_2 =-\epsilon^1\di h.
\label{susy-simple-variation}
\end{align}
Let's check this explicitly. Notice that the variational operator $\delta$
can be treated as if it were a derivation: $\delta(AB) = (\delta A)B +
A(\delta B)$. \todo{Proof that variation is a derivation.} Then,
\begin{align*}
\delta(S) &= \delta(S_0) - \delta(\psi_1)\psi_2S_1 -
\psi_1\delta(\psi_2)S_1 - \psi_1\psi_2\delta(S_1)\\
&= (\delta h)(\di^2 h(\epsilon^1\psi_1+\epsilon^2\psi_2))
      -(\epsilon^2\di h)\psi_2\di^2 h
      -\psi_1(-\epsilon^1\di h)\di^2 h
      -\psi_1\psi_2(\di^3 h (\epsilon^1\psi_1+\epsilon^2\psi_2))\\
&=\di h\di^2 h
(\epsilon^1\psi_1+\epsilon^2\psi_2-\epsilon^2\psi_2+\psi_1\epsilon^1)
+\di^3 h (-\psi_1\psi_1\psi_2\epsilon^1 + \psi_1\epsilon^2\psi_2\psi_2)\\
&=0
\end{align*}
To show that the measure is also invariant, we proceed analogously except
we must keep in mind that we \emph{pullback} the measure and do not push it
forward:
\begin{align*}
f^*(dX\wedge d\psi_1\wedge d\psi_2)
&= df^*(X)\wedge df^*(\psi_1) \wedge df^*(\psi_2)\\
&= dX\wedge d\psi_1\wedge d\psi_2
  -d(\epsilon^1\psi_1+\epsilon^2\psi_2)\wedge d\psi_1\wedge d\psi_2\\
  &\qquad-dX\wedge d(\epsilon^2\di h)\wedge d\psi_2\\
  &\qquad-dX\wedge d\psi_1\wedge d(-\epsilon^1\di h)\\
&= 0
\end{align*}
The last two terms are $0$ because $d(\di h) = (\di^2 h)dX$ and by wedgeing
with another $dX$ zeros out the entire term.

\subsection{Localization}
The group of supersymmetry transformations is surprisingly large. We
continue with the model described in the previous section and in particular
show that if $\di h$ is nowhere zero then the path integral vanishes.
The idea is to use a supersymmetry transformation to make one of the
fermionic fields vanish: $S(X,\psi_1,\psi_2) = S(\hat X,0,\hat \psi_2)$
which will allow us to simplify the path-integral. Choose,
\[ \hat X = X-\FR{\psi_1\psi_2}{\di h(X)},\qquad
   \hat\psi_1 = \alpha(X)\psi_1,\qquad
   \hat\psi_2 = \psi_1+\psi_2.\]
In particular, taking $\alpha(X)=0$ this is a susy transformation with
$\epsilon^1=\epsilon^2=-\FR{\psi_1}{\di h}$. In the new coordinates,
$\hat\psi_1=0$ just as we were looking for. The path integral can be
evaluated:
\begin{align*}
    \int e^{-S(X,\psi_1,\psi_2)}\,dXd\psi_1d\psi_2
&= \int e^{-S(\hat X(X),0,\hat\psi_2(\psi_1+\psi_2))}\,dXd\psi_1d\psi_2\\
&= \int e^{-S(\hat X,0,\hat\psi_2)}\,\left( \alpha - 
(\di^2 h)(\di h)^{-2}\hat\psi_1\hat\psi_2 \right)\,
d\hat Xd\hat \psi_1d\hat \psi_2
\end{align*}
The first term in the sum, $\int d\hat\psi_1 \left(\int e^{-\hat
S}\alpha\right) = 0$ because the argument is independent of $\hat\psi_1$.
The second term vanishes because \todo{Show that the integral vanishes
because the argument is a total derivative.}

This transformation only is valid away from the critical points of $h$.
Taking the path integral as a sum over critical points and expanding 
$h(X) = h(X_c)+\FR{\alpha_c}{2}(X-X_c)^2 + \cdots$, we get
\begin{align*}
    Z &= \sum \int \FR{dXd\psi_1d\psi_2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
    \exp\left(-\FR{1}{2}\alpha_c^2(X-X_c)^2 + \alpha_c\psi_1\psi_2\right)\\
    &= \sum_{X_c} \FR{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int dX
    \exp\left(-\FR{1}{2}\alpha_c^2(X-X_c)^2\right) \alpha_c\\
&= \sum_{X_c} \alpha_c \SFR{1}{\alpha_c^2}
\end{align*}
The factor of $\sqrt{2\pi}$ can be factored out by normalizing the measure
appropriately. This normalization corresponds to defining the correlation
functions as $\FR{Z[\lambda,0]}{Z[0,0]}$, which in our case,
$Z[0,0]=\sqrt{2\pi}$. Therefore the path-integral becomes an integer:
\[ Z = \sum_{X \colon h'(X)=0} \FR{h''(X)}{|h''(X)|}.\]
\begin{remark}[Localization] The path integral is localized at loci where
the fermionic variation under supersymmetry vanishes. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark} The function $h$ in our model is called the
\textbf{superpotential}, the critical points of which characterize the
path-integral.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Deformation Invariance}
\begin{proposition} Suppose $\rho$ is a function such that $\rho$ and
$\di\rho$ vanishes at infinity. Then $h\to h+\rho$ leaves the action
invariant.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Take $g = \di\rho(X)\psi_1$ and consider susy variation $\delta_\epsilon
g$, with $\epsilon^1=\epsilon^2=\epsilon$. Now consider a deformation of
the superpotential: $h\to h+\rho$. Then the action $S = \FR{1}{2}(\di h)^2
- \di^2h \psi_1\psi_2$ transforms with $\epsilon\delta_\rho S =
\delta_\epsilon g$. Therefore $\braket{\delta_\rho S} =\epsilon^{-1}
\braket{\delta_\epsilon g}=0$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Landau--Ginzburg}
After delving into the details of the previous model it is comforting to
note that the complex analogue is what is known as the Landau--Ginzburg
theory: $(X,\psi_1,\psi_2) \leadsto (z,\bar z, \psi_1, \psi_2, \bar\psi_1,
\bar\psi_2)$, and action:
\begin{align}
S = |\di W|^2-(\di^2 W)\psi_1\psi_2 - \overline{\di^2W}\bar\psi_1\bar\psi_2.
\label{LandauGinzburgaction}
\end{align}
We call the holomorphic function $W(z)$ the \textbf{superpotential} and it
will play the role $h$ did in the previous sections. The complex susy
transformations then take the form of:
\begin{align}
\delta z &= \epsilon^1\psi_1+\epsilon^2\psi_2, \qquad
\delta\psi_1 = \epsilon^2\overline{\di W},\qquad
\delta\psi_2 =-\epsilon^1\overline{\di W},\qquad
\delta \bar z=\delta\bar\psi_1 = \delta\bar\psi_2=0\\
\bar\delta\bar z &= \bar\epsilon^1\bar\psi_1+\bar\epsilon^2\bar\psi_2, \qquad
\bar\delta\bar \psi_1 = \bar\epsilon^2\di W,\qquad
\bar\delta\bar \psi_2 =-\bar\epsilon^1\di W,\qquad
\bar\delta z=\bar\delta\psi_1 = \bar\delta\psi_2=0
\label{complexsusytransformations}
\end{align}
Once again, the localization principle applies by choosing
$\epsilon^1=\epsilon^2=-\FR{\psi_1}{\overline{\di W}}$, and writing $W(z) =
W(z_c)+\FR{\alpha_c}{2}(z-z_c)^2+\cdots$, then with proper normalization,
the path-integral integrates to:
\begin{align*}
    Z &= \FR{1}{2\pi}\int
    e^{-|\alpha(z-z_c)|^2}(\alpha\psi^1\psi^2+\bar\alpha\bar\psi_1\bar\psi_2)\,
    dzd\bar z\,d\psi_1d\psi_2\,d\bar\psi_1d\bar\psi_2\\
&= \FR{|\alpha|^2}{2\pi} \sum_{z_c} \int e^{-|\alpha(z-z_c)|^2}\,dzd\bar z\\
&= \FR{|\alpha|^2}{2\pi} \sum_{z_c} \int e^{-|\alpha|^2(x^2+y^2)} \,dxdy
= \sum_{z_c} 1 = \text{\# of critical points of $W$}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Holomorphicity and Correlation functions}
%Existence of supersymmetry does not allow us to trivially compute arbitrary
%correlation functions but it does help with some. In particular, if we have
%an observable $\mc O$ that is invariant under one of the supersymmetry
%transformations then perhaps we can use localization to annihilate that
%fermionic 

\todo{Prove that the Localization principle applies to holomorphic
observables.}
Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic observable. Then by the localization principle,
\begin{align*}
    \braket{f(z)} &= \int f(z) e^{-S}\\
    &= \int f(z)|\di^2 W|^2 e^{-\FR{1}{2}|\di W|^2}\\
    &= \sum_{z_c} f(z_c)
\end{align*}

The set of all fields that vanish under $\bar\delta$ are called
\textbf{chiral fields}. In particular because $\bar\delta$ is a derivation
it follows that this set is closed under multiplication. If we take
$\epsilon^1=\epsilon^2$ then $\bar\delta^2 = 0$ and so we can consider then
cohomology ring $\FR{\ker\bar\delta}{\im\,\bar\delta}$ is often called the
\textbf{chiral ring}.
%\begin{ex}(Chiral Ring for $d=0$ Landau--Ginzburg)
%Applying $\bar\delta$ to the generators of fields, $z,\bar z,
%\psi_i,\bar\psi_i$, we will obtain the image
%In the multivariable case LG action looks like
%\[ S(z_i,\psi^i_1,\psi^i_2)=\sum
%|\di_iW(z_1,\dots,z_N)|^2-\di_i\di_jW\psi^i_1\psi^i_2 -
%\overline{\di_i\di_jW}\bar\psi^i_1\bar\psi^j_2.\]
%Similarly, we can show that $\mc R = \bC[z_1,\dots,z_N]/\braket{\di_i W}$.
%Explore the connections with Poincar\'e duality here and show that this
%describes some of the structure on the chiral ring.

\section{QFT with \texorpdfstring{$d=1$}{d=1}}
Let $M$ be a $1$-dimensional manifold. We know that there are only two
diffeomorphism classes of $1$-manifolds without boundary: $\bR$ and $S^1$.
For simplicity, the only manifold with boundary that we will consider is
the unit interval $[0,1]$.

                S(X_{cl})}{\delta X^2}}}
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structure of Hilbert Space}
\begin{definition}
A \textbf{supersymmetric quantum mechanical system} is $\bZ_2$-graded
Hilbert space $\mc H$ with an even operator $H$ and two odd operators
$Q,Q^\dag$ called supercharges satisfying: $Q^2=(Q^\dagger)^2=0$,
$\{Q,Q^\dag\}=2H$.
\end{definition}
A consequence is $[H,Q]=[H,Q^\dag]=0$. The operator defining the $\bZ_2$
grading is denoted $(-1)^F$. Moreover, $H = \FR{1}{2}\{Q,Q^\dagger\}\ge0$
with equality if and only if the state is annihilated by both supercharges.
If a state is annihlated by a charge then it is invariant under that
symmetry, which means that ground states of a SUSY quantum mechanical
system are automatically supersymmetric.

Since $Q,\cnj Q, (-1)^F$ commute with the Hamiltonian, we first put a
grading on the Hilbert space, by energy levels, and then grade the
resulting subspaces by the $\bZ_2$ grading: $\mc H = \bigoplus \mc
H_n^+\dsum \mc H_n^-$. If we define $Q_1=Q+Q^\dagger$ then \[Q_1^2=2H.\]
For $E_n > 0$, $Q_1^2 = 2E_n$ so $Q_1$ is invertible and defines an
isomorphism \[\mc H^+_n \cong \mc H^-_n.\] 
This has an important consequence for adiabatic/continuous deformations.
Degenerate energy levels may split but the dimension of positive energy
bosonic states is the same as the fermionic states. Some of the degenerate
ground states may split off to form positive energy states, but they again
must come in pairs. The invariant that we should consider is the
difference:
\begin{align} \dim \mc H^B_0 - \dim \mc H^F_0 
= \Tr \bigl[(-1)^Fe^{-\beta H}\bigr].\label{WittenIndex} 
\end{align}
This is called the \textbf{supersymmetric index} or the \textbf{Witten
index} and is often written as $\Tr(-1)^F$. 

To touch base with mathematics let us consider $Q$ as a coboundary operator
of the complex: $\cdots \to \mc H^B\to \mc H^F \to \mc H^B \to \mc H^F \to
\cdots$. This complex is naturally graded by the energy levels, and $Q$
preserves this grading. However, the cohomology is trivial: take a
$Q$-closed state $Q\ket{\alpha}=0$ and apply $\ket\alpha = \FR{1}{2E_n}H
\ket\alpha = \FR{1}{2E_n}\{Q,Q^\dagger\}\ket\alpha = Q \left( \FR{1}{2E_n}
Q^\dagger\ket\alpha \right) \in \im Q$. Therefore the cohomology group on
the bosonic and fermionic Hilbert spaces gets a contribution only from the
(supersymmetric) ground states:
\begin{align} H^B(Q) \cong \mc H^B_{(0)},\qquad H^F(Q) \cong \mc H^F_{(0)}.
\label{groundStateCohom}
\end{align}
Note this is an isomorphism not an equality as $H^\bullet(Q)$ is obtained
by a quotient, where as $\mc H^B_{(0)}$ is an honest subgroup of the
Hilbert space.

In this form, the Witten index $\Tr(-1)^F$, \eqref{WittenIndex}, resembles
the Euler characteristic for the complex. It is also not surprising that
because of the appearance of the trace we may write down path integral
expressions for $\Tr(e^{\beta H})$ and $\Tr\left[ (-1)^Fe^{-\beta H}
\right]$. \todo{Understand the periodic boundary conditions in path
integral for fermions.}
\subsection{Supersymmetric Hilbert space: Example} 
% Example: single-variable potential theory 

\begin{example} Let us consider a supersymmetric theory with a single bosonic
variable $x$ and a complex superpartner $\psi$. The Lagrangian is given by:
\[ L = \FR{1}{2} \dot x^2 - \FR{1}{2} h'(x)^2 + \FR{i}{2}\left( \cnj\psi
\dot\psi - \dot{\cnj\psi}\psi \right) - h''(x)\cnj\psi\psi,\]
where $\cnj\psi=\psi^\dagger$, and the second term plays the role of the
potential $-V(x)$. Now the following transformations change the Lagrangian
by a total time derivative:
\begin{align}
    \delta x = \epsilon\cnj\psi-\cnj\epsilon\psi,\qquad
    \delta \psi=\epsilon(i\dot x+h'(x)),\qquad
    \delta\cnj\psi=\cnj\epsilon(-i\dot x+h'(x)),
    \label{singlepotentialSUSYtransformations}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon=\epsilon_1+i\epsilon_2$ and $\cnj\epsilon=\epsilon^*$ is
the complex conjugate. As long as the boundary variation vanishes (which
will be the case on an open manifold) then the action is invariant. Let
$\delta_1,\delta_2$ be variations as in \eqref{singlepotentialSUSYtransformations}
but with $\epsilon_2=0$ and $\epsilon_1=0$ respectively. Then:
\[[\delta_1,\delta_2]x =2i(\epsilon_1\cnj\epsilon_2 -
\epsilon_2\cnj\epsilon_1)\dot x,\qquad\qquad [\delta_1,\delta_2]\psi
=2i(\epsilon_1\cnj\epsilon_2-\epsilon_2\cnj\epsilon_1)\dot\psi.\]
Applying the Noether procedure with $\epsilon=\epsilon(t)$ to get: $\delta
L = -i\dot\epsilon Q - i\dot{\cnj\epsilon}\cnj Q$ where\todo{Derive this
Noether charge!}
\[Q=\cnj\psi(i\dot x+h'(x)),\qquad\qquad\cnj Q = \psi(-i\dot x+h'(x)).\]

\textbf{Quantizion:} Compute conjugate variables, promote to operators,
impose commutation relations.

$H=\FR{1}{2}p^2+\FR{1}{2}h'(x)^2+\FR{1}{2}h''(x)(\cnj\psi\psi-\psi\cnj\psi)$.

Check:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $[H,Q]=[H,\cnj Q] = 0$, note $Q^\dagger = \cnj Q$.
    \item Let $\mc O(x,\psi,\cnj\psi)$ be any observable (self-adjoint
        operator). Show that $\delta \mc O = [\hat\delta,\mc O]$ where
        $\hat\delta = \epsilon Q+\cnj\epsilon\cnj Q$.
    \item The Hilbert space decomposes as $L^2(\bR,\bC)\ten\bC^2$ as a
        result of the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
\end{enumerate}
Define the fermionic number operator, $F = \cnj\psi\psi$ which measures the
number of fermions of a state (either 0 or 1). A more convenient operator
that (does not annihilate the state without fermions) is given by $(-1)^F$.
Check:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $[F,Q]=Q, [F,\cnj Q]=-\cnj Q$
    \item $\left\{ Q,(-1)^F \right\}=\left\{ \cnj Q,(-1)^F \right\}=0$
    \item $\left\{ Q,Q \right\}=\left\{ \cnj Q,\cnj Q \right\}=0$.
    \item $\left\{ Q,\cnj Q \right\} = 2H$
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\subsection{Supersymmetric Ground States: Towards Morse Theory}
As discussed before, the grounds states of a supersymmetric Hamiltonian are
precisely the states which span the intersection of $\ker Q$ and $\ker\cnj
Q$. In the basis $\{\ket 0, \cnj\psi\ket0\}$, the supercharges are
\[Q=\cnj\psi(ip+h'(x))=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\FR{d}{dx}+h'(x)&0\end{pmatrix},\qquad
\cnj Q=\psi(-ip+h'(x))=\begin{pmatrix}0&-\FR{d}{dx}+h'(x)\\0&0\end{pmatrix}.\]
Therefore we look for $f_1,f_2$ so that $\Psi= f_1(x) \ket0 + f_2(x)
\cnj\psi\ket0$ is annihilated by $Q$ and $\cnj Q$. This leads to two
differential equations with exact solutions: \[f_1(x)=c_1e^{-h(x)},\qquad
f_2(x)=c_2 e^{h(x)}.\] We also want $f_1,f_2 \in L^2$ which means that
they are either $0$ or exponentially decaying at \emph{both} $x=\pm\infty$.
Therefore we have two solutions:
\[ e^{-h(x)}\ket 0, \text{if $h\to\infty$, as $x\to\pm\infty$,}\qquad
e^{h(x)}\cnj\psi\ket 0, \text{if $h\to-\infty$, as $x\to\pm\infty$.}\]

In the case of a harmonic oscillator, $h(x) = \FR{\om}{2}x^2$, with
potential $V(x) = \FR{1}{2}(h'(x))^2 = \FR{\om^2x^2}{2}$. Therefore the
ground states become:
\[ \Psi_{\om>0} = e^{-\FR{1}{2}\om x^2}\ket 0,\qquad \Psi_{\om<0}=
e^{-\FR{1}{2}|\om|x^2}\cnj\psi\ket 0.\]


\subsection{Semi-classical analysis}
We now switch to the Hamiltonian formulation, and at the same time rescale
$h\to \lam h$ for a large $\lam \gg 1$. This goes back to the deformation
invariance result that the action is invarinat under deformations of this
form:
\[H=\FR{1}{2}p^2+\FR{\lam^2}{2}(h'(x))^2+\FR{\lam}{2}h''(x)[\cnj\psi,\psi].\]
The ground states will be localized at the minimum of $(h'(x))^2$.
Expanding $h$ around a critical point, and at the same time rescale the
coordinates $x-x_i = \FR{1}{\sqrt\lam}(\tilde x-\tilde x_i)$ the expansion
becomes \[h(x) = \FR{1}{2\lam}h''(x_i)(\tilde x-\tilde
x_i)^2+\FR{1}{6\lam^{3/2}}h'''(x_i)(\tilde x-\tilde x_i)^3 +
O(\lam^{-2}).\]
The Hamiltonian the becomes:
\[ H = \lam\left( \FR{1}{2}\tilde p^2 + \FR{1}{2}h''(x_i)^2(\tilde x-\tilde
    x_i)^2+\FR{1}{2}h''(x_i)\left[ \cnj\psi,\psi \right]\right)
+\lam^{1/2}(\cdots)+(\cdots)+\mc O(\lam^{-1/2}),\]
where $\tilde p = -i\FR{d}{d\tilde x}$.
The $\mc O(\lam)$ term is a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator with
$\om=h''(x_i)$. The ground state around $x_i$ are:
\begin{align*}
\Psi_i &= e^{-\FR{\lam}{2}h''(x_i)(x-x_i)^2}\ket 0+\mc O(\lam^{-1/2}),\ \ \text{if
$h''(x_i)>0$},\\
\Psi_i &= e^{-\FR{\lam}{2}|h''(x_i)|(x-x_i)^2}\ket 0+\mc O(\lam^{-1/2}),\ \text{if
$h''(x_i)<0$}
\end{align*}
This perturbation theory, tells us there is exactly one supersymmetric
ground state for every critical point and so the Witten index is given by
\[\Tr(-1)^F = \sum_{i=1}^N \sign(h''(x_i)).\]

If the target space is $\bR^n$, with $n$ bosonic and $2n$ fermionic
variables then the Hamiltonian becomes a sum $H = \FR{1}{2}\sum_I
p_I^2+\FR{1}{2}(\di_Ih(x))^2+\FR{1}{2}(\di_I\di_J h)[\cnj\psi^I,\psi^J]$,
and supercharges: $Q = \cnj\psi^I(ip_I+\di_Ih)$, $\cnj Q =
\psi^I(-ip_I+\di_Ih)$. In this case, $h:\bR^n \to \bR$. Expanding about a
critical point of $h$ and choosing the right coordinate system
$\xi^I=\xi^I_{(i)}$: \[ h(x)= h(x_i)+\sum c_I(\xi^I)^2+\cdots\]
In particular, this means that the Hamiltonian simplifies and we again pick
out the $\mc O(\lam)$ term to get the ground state:
\[\Psi_i = \left(\bigotimes_{I\ :\ c_I>0} \exp(-\lam c_I\xi^I)\ket 0\right)
\ten\left(\bigotimes_{I\ :\ c_I<0} \exp(-\lam|c_I|\xi^I)\bar\psi^I\ket0
\right).\] In particular, if we denote the Morse indices of $h$ by $\mu_i$,
the Witten index is given by $\Tr(-1)^F = \sum_{i=1}^N (-1)^{\mu_i}$.

\subsection{Landau--Ginzburg, \texorpdfstring{$n=2m$}{n=2m}}
The Landau--Ginzburg model is complex analogue of our discussion above.
The target space will now be $\bC^m \equiv \bR^{2m}$ and we will take the
Lagrangian to be: \[ L = \sum_{i=1}^m \left(|\dot
    z_i|^2+i\bar \psi^i\di_t\psi^{\bar i}+i\bar\psi^{\bar
    i}\di_t\psi^i-\FR{1}{4}|\di_iW|^2\right)
    -\FR{1}{2}\sum_{ij}(\di_i\di_jW\psi^i\bar\psi^j+\di_{\bar i}\di_{\bar
    j}\cnj W\psi^{\bar i}\bar\psi^{\bar j}).\]
Suppose $W$ has $N$ nondegenerate critical points $p_1,\dots,p_N$. That is,
$\det \di_i\di_j W(p_a)\ne 0$. Expanding $W$ around these critical points
and rewriting in real coordinates we get:
\begin{align*}
    W(z) &= \sum_{k=1}^m (z^k)^2+\mc O((z^k)^3)\\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^m\left[ (x^k)^2-(y^k)^2 \right] + \cdots
\end{align*}
Therefore the Morse indices for \emph{any} critical point are equal to the
complex dimension $m$.

\todo{Show that this Landau--Ginzburg model is $\mc N=2$ supersymmetric.}
\begin{comment}
This Landau--Ginzburg model that we are considering here actually has
two pairs of supersymmetry charges $Q_\pm$ and $\cnj Q_\pm$ that generate
the following transformations:
\begin{align*}
    \delta z^i = \epsilon_+\bar\psi^i-\epsilon_-\psi^i
\end{align*}

\subsection{Sigma Models}
% topology <---> ground states of SUSY-\sg-model
% superpotentials on target <---- physical realization of Morse theory
Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and denote by $\mc T$ the one
dimensional manifold one which our QFT lives. The bosonic and fermionic
variables are maps of the form
\begin{align}
    \phi \colon \mc T\to M,\qquad \psi,\bar\psi\in\Gamma(\mc
    T,\phi^*TM\ten\bC)
    \label{sigmamodelvariables}
\end{align}
The Lagrangian is given by:
\begin{align}
    L &= \FR{1}{2}g_{IJ}\dot\phi^I\dot\phi^J + \FR{i}{2}(\bar\psi^I
    D_t\psi^J-D_t\bar\psi^I\psi^J) - \FR{1}{2} R_{IJKL}\psi^I\bar\psi^J
    \psi^K\bar\psi^L\\
    &=\FR{1}{2}\braket{\dot\phi,\dot\phi} +
    \FR{i}{2}(\braket{\bar\psi,\nabla^{LC}_t\psi}
    -\braket{\nabla^{LC}_t\bar\psi,\psi})
    -\FR{1}{2}R(\psi,\bar\psi,\psi,\bar\psi),
    \label{sigmaModelRiemLag}
\end{align}
The supersymmetry transformations are given by:
\[ \delta\phi^I = \epsilon\bar\psi^I-\bar\epsilon\psi^I,\qquad
\delta\psi^I = \epsilon(i\dot\phi^I-\Gamma^I_{JK}\bar\psi^J\psi^K),\qquad
\delta\bar\psi^I =\bar\epsilon(-i\dot\phi^I-\Gamma^I_{JK}\bar\psi^J\psi^K)s.
\]
The corresponding supercharges are given by:\todo{Work out the Noether
charge for Riemannian manifold sigma model.}
\[ Q = ig_{IJ}\bar\psi^I\dot\phi^J = i\braket{\bar\psi,\dot\psi},\qquad
\bar Q=-ig_{IJ}\psi^I\dot\psi^J=-i\braket{\psi,\dot\psi}.\]
There is an extra symmetry of this free Lagrangian: $(\psi,\bar\psi) \to
(e^{-i\theta}\psi,e^{i\theta}\bar\psi)$. The corresponding Noether charge
is \[F = g_{IJ}\bar\psi^I\psi^J = \braket{\bar\psi,\psi}.\]
Quantizing this system, requires the conjugate momenta: \[p_I = \FR{\di
L}{\di\dot\phi^I}=g_{IJ}\dot\phi^J,\qquad {\pi_\psi}_I =
ig_{IJ}\bar\psi^J.\] Finally, imposing commutation relations:
\[ [\phi^I,p_J] = i\delta^I_{\ J},\qquad \{\psi^I,\bar\psi^J\} = g^{IJ},\]
with all other commutators vanishing. The supercharges are conveniently
write $Q=i\bar\psi^Ip_I, \bar Q = -i\psi^Ip_I$. The ambiguitiy in the
choice of Hamiltonian is fixed if we impose $\{Q,\bar Q\}=2H$.
Finally, note that $[F,Q]=Q$ and $[F,\bar Q]=-\bar Q$ from which we get
$[H,F]=0$.

There exists a natural representation of the observables on the space:
\[\mc H = \Omega(M)\ten\bC,\ \ \text{with}\ \ \braket{\omega_1,\omega_2}_{\mc
H} = \int_M \bar\om_1 \wedge *\om_2.\]
The observables can be assigned the following operators:
\[\phi^I = x^I\cdot,\qquad p_I = -i\nabla_I,\qquad
\bar\psi^I=dx^I\wedge,\qquad \psi^I = g^{IJ} \FR{\di}{\di x^J}\hook\]
The ground state, corresponding to the intersection of all $\ker\psi^I$.
The $F$-charge, or fermion number, is the degree of the form and so the
natural grading on the Hilbert space \[\mc H = \bigoplus
\Omega^p(M)\ten\bC\]
corresponds to the fermion number grading. The supercharge $Q$ is the extrior
derivative, $Q = i\bar\psi^Ip_I = dx^I\wedge\FR{\di}{\di x^I}=d$, and
Hermitian conjugate is $\bar Q = Q^\dagger =d^\dagger$. Finally, we compute
the Hamiltonian $H$ by the supersymmetry relation \[H = \FR{1}{2}\{Q,\bar
Q\} = \FR{1}{2}(dd^\dagger+d^\dagger d) = \FR{1}{2}\Delta,\] the
Laplace--Beltrami operator. The ground states are then just the harmonic
forms: \[\mc H_{(0)} = \Harm(M,g) = \bigoplus_{p=0}^n \Harm^p(M,g).\]

Now we are starting to see the correspondence between supersymmetric
quantum mechanics and differential geometry. In fact, Hodge theory is not
too far away! As we showed before, the ground states can be characterized
by cohomology (see \eqref{groundStateCohom}). Since $[F,Q]=Q$ the
$Q$-complex may be graded by the fermion number, or in more mathematical
language, the de Rham cohomology is graded by the degree of the forms.
In fact, since we know the ground states correspond to the the harmonic
forms we use the same proof as for \eqref{groundStateCohom} to show that
\[\mc H_{(0)}=\Harm(M,g) \cong H^\bullet(Q) = H^\bullet_{dR}(M),\]
and even more that with respect to the fermion number grading,
\[\Harm(M,g) \cong H^p_{dR}(M).\]
The Witten index, $\Tr(-1)^F$, counting the parity of the fermion numbers
becomes: \[\Tr(-1)^F = \sum_{p=0}^n (-1)^p \dim H^p_{dR}(M) = \chi(M).\]
