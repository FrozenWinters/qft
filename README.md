# Quantum Field Theory Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we will be covering the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Spring 2016: we will (hopefully) be covering the basics of mirror
  symmetry, both homological and SYZ.

# Winter 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run weekly:
every Friday 4:30pm - 6:00pm in MC5403.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday Jan 8th): Classical strings; 1.1-1.4.1 in notes.
  - From the QFT seminar last term, we now have the necessary
    background to approach string theory and supersymmetry, the focus
    of the seminar this term. As with all physical theories, string
    theory begins with a (classical) action - the Polyakov action for
    relativistic strings - which we will derive by analogy with the
    action of relativistic point particles. We will then discuss the
    gauge symmetries of the Polyakov action in preparation for its
    quantization.
* Week 2 (Friday Jan 15th): Quantized strings; 1.4.2-1.5.3 in notes.
  - The classical relativistic string can be quantized in many
    different ways. As with QFT, we explore two: canonical
    quantization and path integrals. Canonical quantization directly
    gives the spectrum and state space of a free string, along with
    the dimension D = 26 of bosonic string theory. Path integrals, on
    the other hand, prepare us for interacting string theory. We will
    see that the path integral quantization of strings is similar to
    that of quantum electrodynamics, but there are additional
    complications, called Faddeev-Popov ghosts, arising from the
    non-abelian gauge group.
* Week 3 (Friday Jan 22nd): Conformal field theory.
* Week 4 (Friday Jan 29th): Conformal field theory.
