# Quantum Field Theory Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we will be covering the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Spring 2016: we will (hopefully) be covering the basics of mirror
  symmetry, both homological and SYZ.

# Winter 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run weekly:
every Friday 4:30pm - 6:00pm in MC5403.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday Jan 8th): Classical strings; 1.1-1.4.1 in notes.
  - From the QFT seminar last term, we now have the necessary
    background to approach string theory and supersymmetry, the focus
    of the seminar this term. As with all physical theories, string
    theory begins with a (classical) action - the Polyakov action for
    relativistic strings - which we will derive by analogy with the
    action of relativistic point particles. We will then discuss the
    gauge symmetries of the Polyakov action in preparation for its
    quantization.
* Week 2 (Friday Jan 15th): Quantized strings; 1.4.2-1.5.3 in notes.
  - The classical relativistic string can be quantized in many
    different ways. As with QFT, we explore two: canonical
    quantization and path integrals. Canonical quantization directly
    gives the spectrum and state space of a free string, along with
    the dimension D = 26 of bosonic string theory. Path integrals, on
    the other hand, prepare us for interacting string theory. We will
    see that the path integral quantization of strings is similar to
    that of quantum electrodynamics, but there are additional
    complications, called Faddeev-Popov ghosts, arising from the
    non-abelian gauge group.
* Week 3 (Friday Jan 22nd): Conformal field theory; sect. 2.1 in notes.
  - The next step in our journey to unravel the ball of string is to
    get comfortable with aspects of Conformal Field Theory. Many of
    the seminars to follow in this series will rely heavily on the
    computational tools from CFT and so we will spend some time going
    through examples that will come up in the future. In particular,
    in this seminar we will talk about normal ordering, operator
    product expansions, and Virasoro algebras in the context of 2
    dimensional free field theories.
* Week 4 (Friday Jan 29th): Conformal field theory; sect. 2.2 in notes.
* Week 5 (**Wednesday Feb 5th, MC5479**): BRST quantization; chpt. 3
  in notes.
  - With the tools of conformal field theory, we can now construct the
    state space of a bosonic string in a fairly rigorous manner.
    However, not all the states will be physical states, which must be
    annihilated by the Virasoro algebra. Fortunately, there is a
    simple criterion for a state to be physical: we shall construct an
    operator, called the BRST charge, such that its cohomology is
    precisely the physical state space. This operator lives within a
    larger framework, called BRST quantization, for systematically
    constructing the physical state spaces of a large class of gauge
    theories with constraints. We briefly discuss the relationship
    between BRST and symplectic reduction, and then apply it to the
    bosonic string. After all that work, we shall see the no-ghost
    theorem, which allows us to avoid using the heavy machinery of
    BRST in practice.
* Week 6 (Friday Feb 12th): Amplitudes; chpt. 4 in notes.
* Week 7 (Friday Feb 19th): T-Duality; chpt. 5 in notes.
