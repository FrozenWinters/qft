# Mirror Symmetry Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we covered the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Summer 2016: we will cover the basics of mirror symmetry, both
  homological and SYZ. See mirrorsym-notes.tex.

# Summer 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run twice a
week:
* (**until May 16th**) Mondays 2:30pm - 4:00pm in M3 2134,
* (**starting May 24th**) Tuesdays 12:30pm - 2:00pm in M3 3103.
* Fridays 12:00pm - 1:30pm in M3 2134.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday May 6th): Mathematical
  Preliminaries I; 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 in notes.
  - We will review sheaf cohomology and Poincare duality. We will also
    introduce Morse homology, the finite-dimensional version of Floer
    homology, which shows up in the statement of homological mirror
    symmetry.
* Week 2 (Monday May 9th): Mathematical Preliminaries II; section 1.2
  in notes.
  - We will review Poincare and Serre duality, in particular
    emphasizing the connection between Poincare duality and Thom
    classes. Then we review Chern classes, and use this connection to
    explore properties of the top Chern class, i.e. the Euler class.
    Finally we introduce and practice using two big theorems:
    generalized Gauss--Bonnet and Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch. A lot of
    the calculations today will be useful later on.
* Week 2 (Friday May 13th): Physical Preliminaries I; sections 2.1
  and 2.2 in notes.
* Week 3 (Monday May 16th): Mathematical Preliminaries III;
  section 1.2 in notes.
  - A continuation of Mathematical Preliminaries II. We'll finish up
    the discussion of characteristic classes, introduce
    Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch, and do some example calculations and
    usages, e.g. using it to prove the generalized Gauss--Bonnet
    formula.
* Week 3 (Friday May 20th): **canceled** due to [GAP](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/15-16/gap).
* Week 4 (Tuesday May 24rd): Mathematical Preliminaries IV:
  sections 1.1.3 and 1.2.5 in notes.
  - We introduce equivariant cohomology, which is a cohomology theory
    that captures the group action on a space, and the localization
    principle from a mathematical perspective. Our main goal is to
    state and justify the Atiyah--Bott localization formula, which
    will be our main tool for integrating equivariant cohomology
    classes. These tools form the basis for Gromov--Witten theory and
    have many other applications in mathematical physics whenever
    there is a gauge group.
* Week 4 (Friday May 27th): Physics Preliminaries II; section 2.3 in
  notes.
* Week 5 (Tuesday May 31st): Deformations of Calabi--Yau manifolds
