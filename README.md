# Mirror Symmetry Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we covered the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.

  homological and SYZ. See mirrorsym-notes.tex.

# Summer 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run twice a
week:
* Tuesdays 12:30pm - 2:00pm in M3 3103.
* Fridays 12:00pm - 1:30pm in M3 2134.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday May 6th): Mathematical
  Preliminaries I; 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 in notes.
  - We will review sheaf cohomology and Poincare duality. We will also
    introduce Morse homology, the finite-dimensional version of Floer
    homology, which shows up in the statement of homological mirror
    symmetry.
* Week 2 (Monday May 9th): Mathematical Preliminaries II; section 1.2
  in notes.
  - We will review Poincare and Serre duality, in particular
    emphasizing the connection between Poincare duality and Thom
    classes. Then we review Chern classes, and use this connection to
    explore properties of the top Chern class, i.e. the Euler class.
    Finally we introduce and practice using two big theorems:
    generalized Gauss--Bonnet and Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch. A lot of
    the calculations today will be useful later on.
* Week 2 (Friday May 13th): Physical Preliminaries I; sections 2.1
  and 2.2 in notes.
* Week 3 (Monday May 16th): Mathematical Preliminaries III;
  section 1.2 in notes.
  - A continuation of Mathematical Preliminaries II. We'll finish up
    the discussion of characteristic classes, introduce
    Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch, and do some example calculations and
    usages, e.g. using it to prove the generalized Gauss--Bonnet
    formula.
* Week 3 (Friday May 20th): **canceled** due to [GAP](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/15-16/gap).
* Week 4 (Tuesday May 24rd): Mathematical Preliminaries IV;
  sections 1.1.3 and 1.2.5 in notes.
  - We introduce equivariant cohomology, which is a cohomology theory
    that captures the group action on a space, and the localization
    principle from a mathematical perspective. Our main goal is to
    state and justify the Atiyah--Bott localization formula, which
    will be our main tool for integrating equivariant cohomology
    classes. These tools form the basis for Gromov--Witten theory and
    have many other applications in mathematical physics whenever
    there is a gauge group.
* Week 4 (Friday May 27th): **canceled**
* Week 5 (Tuesday May 31st): Mathematical Preliminaries V;
  sections 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 in notes.
  - I'll use an hour or so to review Kahler and Calabi--Yau geometry.
    In particular we need to become really cozy with Hodge diamonds,
    especially for Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Then we'll look at the overall
    structure of the Calabi--Yau moduli space and take a small peek at
    mirror symmetry.
* Week 5 (Friday June 3rd): **canceled**
* Week 6 (Tuesday June 7th): Physical Preliminaries II; section 2.2 in
  notes.
  - I'll briefly review what Anton did last time (i.e. structure of
    supersymmetric quantum mechanical theories) and continue with the
    d=1 case. Mainly for d=1 we'll see our first sigma model. From it,
    using perturbative techniques, we'll "derive" Hodge theory. Then
    we"ll see what instantons are and how they give non-perturbative
    corrections to the perturbative techniques (which are locally
    correct but not globally correct), and using them we"ll "derive"
    Morse theory.
* Week 6 (Friday June 10th): Physical Preliminaries III; section 2.3
  in notes.
  - We covered the d=2 free scalar boson, and compactified the target
    to obtain the sigma model on the circle. By computing the
    partition function of the latter theory, we saw T-duality.
* Week 7 (Tuesday June 14th): Physical Preliminaries IV; section 2.4
  in notes.
  - I'll cover the superspace formalism, in particular the theory of a
    single chiral superfield, which will reduce in d=0 and d=1 to the
    Landau--Ginzburg theories and sigma models we have seen. This
    formalism allows us to directly construct a huge family of d=2
    supersymmetric theories and investigate their symmetries (and
    symmetry breaking). We'll write down the general form of d=2
    nonlinear sigma models, and d=2 Landau--Ginzburg models, and see
    some hints of the LG/CY correspondence between these two classes
    of theories.
* Week 7 (Friday June 17th): **canceled** due to convocation.
* Week 8 (Tuesday June 21st): Calabi-Yau moduli and Mirror Symmetry for
  the Quintic; sections 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 in notes.
* Week 8 (Friday June 24th): Introduction to Gromov-Witten theory I;
  section 3.1 in notes.
