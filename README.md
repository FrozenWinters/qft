# Mirror Symmetry Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we covered the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Summer 2016: we will cover the basics of mirror symmetry, both
  homological and SYZ. See mirrorsym-notes.tex.

# Summer 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run twice a
week:
* Mondays 2:30pm - 4:00pm in M3 2134, and
* Fridays 12:00pm - 1:30pm in M3 2134.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday May 6th): Mathematical
  Preliminaries I; 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 in notes.
  - We will review sheaf cohomology and Poincare duality. We will also
    introduce Morse homology, the finite-dimensional version of Floer
    homology, which shows up in the statement of homological mirror
    symmetry.
* Week 2 (Monday May 9th): Mathematical Preliminaries II; section 1.2
  in notes.
  - We will review Poincare and Serre duality, in particular
    emphasizing the connection between Poincare duality and Thom
    classes. Then we review Chern classes, and use this connection to
    explore properties of the top Chern class, i.e. the Euler class.
    Finally we introduce and practice using two big theorems:
    generalized Gauss--Bonnet and Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch. A lot of
    the calculations today will be useful later on.
* Week 2 (Friday May 13th): Physical Preliminaries I; sections 2.1
  and 2.2 in notes.
