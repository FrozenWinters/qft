# Quantum Field Theory Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we covered the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Summer 2016: we will cover the basics of mirror symmetry, both
  homological and SYZ. See mirrorsym-notes.tex.

# Summer 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run twice a
week:
* Mondays 2:30pm - 4:00pm in M3 2134, and
* Fridays 12:00pm - 1:30pm in M3 2134.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday May 6th): Mathematical
  Preliminaries I; 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 in notes.
  - We will review sheaf cohomology and Poincare duality. We will also
    introduce Morse homology, the finite-dimensional version of Floer
    homology, which shows up in the statement of homological mirror
    symmetry.
* Week 2 (Monday May 9th): Mathematical Preliminaries II
