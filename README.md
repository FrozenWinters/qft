# Quantum Field Theory Learning Seminar

* Fall 2015: we covered the basics of QFT. See qft-notes.tex.
* Winter 2016: we will be covering the basics of string theory and
  supersymmetry. See stringy-notes.tex.
* Spring 2016: we will (hopefully) be covering the basics of mirror
  symmetry, both homological and SYZ.

# Winter 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run weekly:
every Friday 4:30pm - 6:00pm in MC5403.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday Jan 8th): Classical strings; 1.1-1.4.1 in notes.
* Week 2 (Friday Jan 15th): Quantized strings; 1.4.2-1.5.3 in notes.
* Week 3 (Friday Jan 22nd): Conformal field theory.
* Week 4 (Friday Jan 29th): Conformal field theory.
