# Summer 2016 Schedule

Unless otherwise announced on this page, the seminar will run twice a
week:
* Tuesdays 12:30pm - 2:00pm in M3 3103.
* Fridays 12:00pm - 1:30pm in M3 2134.

Details about upcoming talks will be added incrementally as time
progresses. For now, the plan is:
* Week 1 (Friday May 6th): Mathematical
  Preliminaries I; 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 in notes.
  - We will review sheaf cohomology and Poincare duality. We will also
    introduce Morse homology, the finite-dimensional version of Floer
    homology, which shows up in the statement of homological mirror
    symmetry.
* Week 2 (Monday May 9th): Mathematical Preliminaries II; section 1.2
  in notes.
  - We will review Poincare and Serre duality, in particular
    emphasizing the connection between Poincare duality and Thom
    classes. Then we review Chern classes, and use this connection to
    explore properties of the top Chern class, i.e. the Euler class.
    Finally we introduce and practice using two big theorems:
    generalized Gauss--Bonnet and Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch. A lot of
    the calculations today will be useful later on.
* Week 2 (Friday May 13th): Physical Preliminaries I; sections 2.1
  and 2.2 in notes.
* Week 3 (Monday May 16th): Mathematical Preliminaries III;
  section 1.2 in notes.
  - A continuation of Mathematical Preliminaries II. We'll finish up
    the discussion of characteristic classes, introduce
    Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch, and do some example calculations and
    usages, e.g. using it to prove the generalized Gauss--Bonnet
    formula.
* Week 3 (Friday May 20th): **canceled** due to [GAP](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/15-16/gap).
* Week 4 (Tuesday May 24rd): Mathematical Preliminaries IV;
  sections 1.1.3 and 1.2.5 in notes.
  - We introduce equivariant cohomology, which is a cohomology theory
    that captures the group action on a space, and the localization
    principle from a mathematical perspective. Our main goal is to
    state and justify the Atiyah--Bott localization formula, which
    will be our main tool for integrating equivariant cohomology
    classes. These tools form the basis for Gromov--Witten theory and
    have many other applications in mathematical physics whenever
    there is a gauge group.
* Week 4 (Friday May 27th): **canceled**
* Week 5 (Tuesday May 31st): Mathematical Preliminaries V;
  sections 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 in notes.
  - I'll use an hour or so to review Kahler and Calabi--Yau geometry.
    In particular we need to become really cozy with Hodge diamonds,
    especially for Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Then we'll look at the overall
    structure of the Calabi--Yau moduli space and take a small peek at
    mirror symmetry.
* Week 5 (Friday June 3rd): **canceled**
* Week 6 (Tuesday June 7th): Physical Preliminaries II; section 2.2 in
  notes.
  - I'll briefly review what Anton did last time (i.e. structure of
    supersymmetric quantum mechanical theories) and continue with the
    d=1 case. Mainly for d=1 we'll see our first sigma model. From it,
    using perturbative techniques, we'll "derive" Hodge theory. Then
    we"ll see what instantons are and how they give non-perturbative
    corrections to the perturbative techniques (which are locally
    correct but not globally correct), and using them we"ll "derive"
    Morse theory.
* Week 6 (Friday June 10th): Physical Preliminaries III; section 2.3
  in notes.
  - We covered the d=2 free scalar boson, and compactified the target
    to obtain the sigma model on the circle. By computing the
    partition function of the latter theory, we saw T-duality.
* Week 7 (Tuesday June 14th): Physical Preliminaries IV; section 2.4
  in notes.
  - I'll cover the superspace formalism, in particular the theory of a
    single chiral superfield, which will reduce in d=0 and d=1 to the
    Landau--Ginzburg theories and sigma models we have seen. This
    formalism allows us to directly construct a huge family of d=2
    supersymmetric theories and investigate their symmetries (and
    symmetry breaking). We'll write down the general form of d=2
    nonlinear sigma models, and d=2 Landau--Ginzburg models, and see
    some hints of the LG/CY correspondence between these two classes
    of theories.
* Week 7 (Friday June 17th): **canceled** due to convocation.
* Week 8 (Tuesday June 21st): Calabi-Yau moduli and Mirror Symmetry for
  the Quintic; sections 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 in notes.
  - We'll see the story of mirror symmetry in the simplest case: the
    quintic hypersurface in P^4. We'll first have to sketch the
    overall structure of the Calabi-Yau moduli space, in particular
    how it locally decomposes as a sum of complex moduli and Kahler
    moduli. Then we'll define some relevant Hodge-theoretic structures
    on the space of complex moduli. The quintic hypersurface will
    provide nice concrete examples of these structures. (We don't have
    the machinery yet to look at the Kahler moduli; that will have to
    wait until we define Gromov-Witten invariants.) Finally, we'll see
    what mirror symmetry has to say about these structures. One of
    them, the Yukawa coupling, has a very interesting connection to
    Gromov-Witten invariants, especially the ones counting rational
    curves in the Calabi-Yau manifold.
* Week 8 (Friday June 24th): Introduction to Gromov-Witten theory I;
  section 3.1 in notes.
  - We'll start on the long journey of exploring the Kahler moduli
    space (i.e. the "A-model variation of Hodge structure"). The first
    step is to learn Gromov-Witten theory. The first step in that is
    to define generalizations of the moduli space of marked Riemann
    surfaces, and define, on these spaces, rational numbers called
    Gromov-Witten invariants. These numbers, as we'll see later on,
    roughly count the number of rational curves in a space.
* Week 9 (Tuesday June 28th): Toric Geometry II
* Week 10 (Tuesday July 5th): Introduction to Gromov-Witten theory II;
  section 3.2 in notes.
  - We'll see the connection between enumerative geometry and the
    moduli space of stable maps via Kontsevich's recursion for the
    number of degree d rational maps passing through 3d-1 generic
    points. In particular we'll define Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants
    and more general numbers called gravitational descendant
    invariants. These arise naturally when considering differential
    equations involving GW invariants. We will also touch on the
    technical issue of defining the virtual fundamental class for the
    moduli space of stable maps, in order to have a good notion of
    what it means to integrate over it.
* Week 10 (Friday July 8th): Introduction to Gromov-Witten theory III;
  section 3.3 in notes.
  - Gromov-Witten invariants can be nicely encoded in a structure
    called a quantum cohomology ring; these come in two flavors, the
    small and the big. These are the ordinary cohomology rings, but
    with a deformed "quantum product". Enumerative data, including
    rational curve counts, is encoded in the small quantum product,
    while the associativity of the big quantum product (known as the
    WDVV equation) encodes relations such as Kontsevich's recursion.
    Finally, we briefly look at the Dubrovin formalism, in preparation
    for Givental's approach to the proof of mirror symmetry.
* Week 11 (Friday July 12th): Introduction to Gromov-Witten theory IV;
  section 3.4 in notes.
  - To calculate Gromov-Witten invariants, it is convenient to move to
    equivariant cohomology and use localization, because the fixed
    point loci of the moduli space of stable maps (in genus 0) is
    purely combinatorial and can be encoded as graphs. We first
    re-familiarize ourselves with localization by applying it to
    projective space. Then we do the moduli space of stable maps. Then
    we apply this newly gained machinery to the problem of multiple
    covers: how do degree k covers of degree d stable maps contribute
    to the Gromov-Witten invariant of degree kd?
