  Abstract                 = {Let {\$}X{\$} be an algebraic stack in the sense of Deligne-Mumford. We construct a purely {\$}0{\$} -dimensional algebraic stack over {\$}X{\$} (in the sense of Artin), the intrinsic normal cone {\$}{\{}{\backslash}frak C{\}}{\_}X{\$} . The notion of (perfect) obstruction theory for {\$}X{\$} is introduced, and it is shown how to construct, given a perfect obstruction theory for {\$}X{\$} , a pure-dimensional virtual fundamental class in the Chow group of {\$}X{\$} . We then prove some properties of such classes, both in the absolute and in the relative context. Via a deformation theory interpretation of obstruction theories we prove that several kinds of moduli spaces carry a natural obstruction theory, and sometimes a perfect one.},
